# Overview & Purpose
The following are the conclusions and judgements that can be made based on the [identity equations](whoiam.md) while in the absence of other knowledge. The inferences inherent in the BEGIN and END iterations provide a foundation for understanding the self and its place in the world. The BEGIN and END iteraions are limits ('floor', 'ceiling') on each life, such that there is a finite amount of time between either iteration. The time between the iterations is the duration of existence (life), which is perceived by the self through memory (stored memories in a sequence). Self-expression is the means by which *the internal processes for perceiving and defining one's self* are externalized, or made real in the world. Living, or *to be alive*, is a stream of externalizations over the course of a lifetime. At all times, living is an **expression of the self**, *by the self*, <ins>for the self</ins>. Therefore, living is art, or an application of human creative skill and imagination. 

a life lived is a magnum opus. //greatest work of art in a lifetime, most important of any work. 'work' refers to a means of self-expression that exhibits a value or combination of values. 

Other opuses: //an externalization that exhibits a value
* work of kindness
* work of gratitude
* work of love
* work of skill
* work of art
* work of...

# universal truth, or a common good

**Why is a common good necessary?**

* Once an answer to 'Who am I?' is established, the question 'What am I?' naturally follows because an explanation is needed for *how* or *in what manner* an identity exists in reality (I am but how?).  The answer to the question 'What am I?' serves as the foundation for understanding the self because the answer meaningfully connects an identity to reality. 
* What am I? //'I am a living being.' 
* In order to be considered 'living', an identity (self) must be 'alive'. //I know I am alive because the BEGIN iteration demonstrates that self is alive utilizing the binary state of alive/not alive
* Living (to be alive) is a binary state, so only one alternative exists. Any reasonable person would agree that being alive is better than being not alive. (good > not good (bad), alive > not alive)
* Life is good. //existential calm, or I know who and what I am. I conceive my self and understand how my self exists in reality and therefore can begin to make sense of the world around me. 'good' is a judgment made about what the binary state ('alive'/'not alive') *represents*, or 'Life'. The judgement that *Life is good* is universal because the only alternative ('I am not alive') represents death, which any reasonable person would percieve as 'not good'. Death is 'not good' from the perspective of the self because it reresents the end of self. Death is also good as a part of Life. See also END iteration, c = 0
* A shared consciousness is created whenever there is shared knowledge (truth or belief) between two or more individuals. for example, two people have a shared consciousness when they have shared the same experience (ie truth, actual event) or when they believe the same thing (ie belief, government/religion/choice). So, a common good (*universally true AND good*) has the potential to be the foundation of a universally true shared consciouness (ie every individual agrees that 'Life is good').

# The Lonely Isle

**Key Topics**

* Imagine yourself, alone on a desert island, seeking the unknown. 
* Ultimately, what is knowable is what is observable on the island. //no other person on island, alone with self and knowledge of identity equations. the BEGIN iteration shows that 'I am alive'. knowable = observable
* Its observable that you are alive, a living being. //because living is a binary state, only one alternative exists. any reasonable person would agree that being alive is better than being dead. (good > not good (bad), alive > not alive)
* with the judgement that 'Life is good', existential angst converts to existential calm. //I am because I live. The END iteration shows that an end for self is inevitable, so it is good to be alive when it is always true that 'I will end'. 
* I am on the Lonely Isle and I am equipped with the knowledge that I will die someday (future) and the observation that I am alive (now).

**What can also be known?** 

I am on the Lonely Isle and I am equipped with the knowledge that I will die someday (future) and the observation that I am alive (now).

**Conclusions about Life**

* The time between now and the future (end) is what remains of your life. 'time' is a limited resource of life with scarcity for a given context. *Therefore, time has value.*
* I know I exist (I am) because I can observe that I am alive. it is observable that 'this' is not empty, because I exist (now). *Therefore, 'this' is not empty because I exist now.*
* it will be observable that life compounds over time, building upon itself. each life (living being) is an event that has begun but not yet ended, or an incomplete event. the binary state of complete/incomplete describes a chronological state, whereby an *incomplete* state must precede the *complete* state. the *incomplete* state positions a living being at a point in time before its end (*complete*), which the living being is progressing towards (in time) because it is always true that each life will end. *Therefore, Life is tributary to itself.*

**Conclusions about Time** //hypothetical

**Key Points**
* Life (existence) has a beginning and an end, a duration of time lies between those two points in time.
* Time is a product of perception. The self percieves time through memory. Memory is sequential.
* A constant value for Time can be calculated using the value for self because time is something that is perceived.
* The *perception of time* is the result of the golden ratio equation when the value for *a* is ϕ (self) and the value for *b* is 1 (existence). The product of these values is a representation of time amd  is ϕ or 1.618....
* Every event in reality has the temporal dimensions of a beginning and an end, a start and a finish, an open and a close. //BEGN and END iterations

**Calculation of Time Constant** //hypothetical
* As a fractal set, identity at any time is the product of c = 1 - ϕ. The value of ϕ represents the self. The value '1' in the equation represents a life, which is meant as the self's existence (here & now). So, the value of self is ϕ and the value of the relative life is 1.
* An equivalency shown in the identity equations is 1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ (see the 'I exist' equation, represents existence)
* An equivalency shown in the identity equations is ϕ = 1 - 1/ϕ (see the value of variable answers, represents self)
* 'Life' is an event with a beginning and an end. The self perceieves 'time' through its perception of 'life'. //BEGIN and END iterations
* The BEGIN and END iteraions are limits ('floor', 'ceiling') on each life, such that there is a finite amount of time between either iteration. The time between the iterations is the duration of existence (life), which is perceived by the self through memory (stored memories in a sequence).
* **ϕ *as time* = ϕ *as self* + 1 (*existence*) / ϕ *as self*** //important, ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/ϕ
* The *perception of time* is the result of the golden ratio equation when the value for *a* is ϕ (self) and the value for *b* is 1 (existence). The product of these values is a representation of time amd  is ϕ or 1.618....

# Time Constant //hypothetical
* ϕ or 1.618....
* ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/ϕ
* The Golden Ratio, or Phi, is a constant produced by time //hypothesis

**Quantum Mechanics** //support for ϕ *as time*
* The g-factor of the electron is defined as the ratio of its magnetic moment to its spin angular momentum.  The electron g-factor is due to the stretching of space-time as the electron spins at the speed of light.
* Electron g-factor = -2/sin(ϕ)
* Proton g-factor = 2ϕ/sin(1/ϕ)
* The Golden Ratio, or Phi, is a constant produced by time //hypothesis

# Existential Calm

**Key Topics**
* As a state of 'readiness', existential calm parries for the mind and for the body. The combination of the knowledge that 1) 'I am alive' and 2) 'I will end' equips an identity to understand the 'here' and 'now' as it relates to the self //life always good because at minimum, its good to be alive.
* I know who and what I am. //I am a living being and life is a binary state
* I am because I live.  //Life is good because i am alive (judgement)

**Why am I here (on the Lonely Isle)?**

* I am equipped with the judgement that 'Life is good', the knowledge that I will die, and the observation that I am alive. 
* While the *judgement* that 'Life is good' does not provide full assurance, the fact remains that I *will* continue to live on with or without assurance.
* The simplest explanation for "Why am I here?"  is that 'I have life' and 'Life is good' because life (all life) exists for itself (for *good*), by itself (for *good*).

**Why is it good?**
* Because the existence of life means that 'this' is not empty. //each life ultimately 'something from nothing.' simplification for universal causation
* Because a life is an opportunity. Life is time and moments are opporunitites. //time has value
* Because life is slow and tributary. each life is a component within the unison of Life. //life has universal scope

# Self-Expression and Externalization //c = 1 - 1.618, so c = -0.618 (or c = -1/ϕ)

**Main points**
* Identity is incalcuable in the absence of the self (ϕ). //see BEGIN iteration, self is undefined (c = 1 - *undefined*)
* In this way, identity becomes an expression of the self due to the fact that the self is necessary to produce an identity. //'identity' as a product of an equation for the self. 'identity' as a snapshot of the self. 
* So self-expression is the manifestation of the self for an identity. the self can be expressed in words and actions (externalization).

**Key Topics**
* The relationship between 'self' and 'identity'
* The 'self' as an engine for identity //the self generates identity (snapshots of the self in time)

**What does it mean that c = -1/ϕ?**
* At any point in time, identity is being expressed through externalizations of the self. this also means that each expression of the identity is limited by the means of externalization. 
* In the Golden Ratio calculations, it is shown that variable answers to the question "Who are you?" (*self-definitions*) have the value of 1/ϕ and are contextual. it may be that the value of -1/ϕ is the contextual value of the self (*self-concept*).  identity (-1/ϕ), and by extension all self expression, is the contextual externalization of self-concept. //explanation for |-1/ϕ|, context reduces the value of self-percpetion due to limitations inherent to the means of externalization. //needs clarification

**Why is it negative?**
* Self-perception is an internal process first. The value of variable answers *a, b* in the equation for the sense of self are shown to be positive values used to conceive one's self (internal process). identity is a negative value because it is the externalization of an internal process, or an inverse of the internal process of concept, which can be shown to be composed of positive value. //positive to negative, internal to external, self concept limited to context
* What ever the means of externalization, the self that is being expressed is a *reflection* of the self, or how the self is conceived.

# A Conversation with Death

**Key Topics**
* Why? //cannot know life without first understanding death
* when the self encounters death, death asks two questions in sequence. "are you ready?" and "are you willing?" 
* A 'yes' and a 'yes' signals the end of the identity //a master of fate, by fate mastered
* A 'yes' and a 'no' signals the embrace of life //no fear of death and the choice to live
* A 'no' signals fear of death //"are you ready?"

**Are you ready?**

* If yes, proceed. //'ready' is a state of mind, existential calm. life is good and death is a part of each life, death must also be good *in some manner*.
* If no, wait. //to wait is to dread

**Are you willing?**
* For most, the answer is 'no' //there are only a few things someone may be willing to die for
* The fact remains that the answer 'yes' is utlimately a choice a self is *able* to make. //cases where willingness to die exists: suicide, honor (war), love (romeo and juliet), conviction (personal truth, a cause)
* This question highlights the value of ability and intent //the ability to end exists for the self, but the self must have intent in order to end.
* Intent is a choice and ability is a means

# Identity as oneness or Identity as a multiple
* The 'I am' equation shows that oneness can be achieved for the self by devaluing the definitions assigned to one's self (recognizing external influence)
* Split or multiple identities are a result of disproportionate valuations of the definitions for the self, which in turn distorts self-perception.
* Split identities can be reintegrated by reassigning/recalculating the value of the definitions for the self. //re-proportion of self-perception value and the untrue definitions for the self

# Questions for Self

**Key Topics**
* Who am I?  //Who you are is based on how you perceive yourself and define your self to others. Consider the core values and traits that are necessary to those identifications and why you chose those identifications in the first place.
* Why am I here? //that is a question that can only be answered by the asker. however, the question "What can I *do*?" is more relevant in any given situation. this question gives direction/purpose through ability ("What *can* I do?"). "Why am I here?" is seeking contextless direction/purpose, any answer will not change the fact that you are here and you *need* to do something so "What *can* I *do*?" becomes more relevant.
* What do I do with my life?  //start with: what does the end of my life look like? and work backwards. How do you get there and what can you do now to get there? (direction)
* Who do I choose to spend time with? //'shared consciousness' as a relationship between two or more persons, where is the greatest positive overlap?
* What happens when I die?  //the loop of 'a life' completes. a birth at the beginning and a death at the end. birth and death are like two book ends and each life is composed of the stories in between.

# artofliving

**Topics**
* Why 'art of living'? //'living' as 'art', because art is self expression and living is expressing one's self over a lifetime.
* How? Themes. Life is good. //existential calm
* by what thoughts and devices do you live your life? how do the themes you chose for yourself express themselves?
* convert to framework //framework must work with the duality of internal/external

**List of themes and associated values** //'values' here is different from 'values' when referring to identity equations.

*Overthemes*: Patience, Trust, Freedom //essential to all themes

*Skilled in hand, subtle in mind* //external, internal

# Narrative
My name is Cullen Drummey and I believe life is good. One of my favorite things in my life is a gallon pitcher of water I keep inside the door of our refridgerator. What makes the water special is that I put a single bad of jasmine green tea in each pitcher (daily). The water takes on the slightest essence of jasmine in flavor and aroma, and it is very pleasant. I also love my wife and my two sons very much. She is a beautiful and brilliant woman with so much love in her heart. My first, Ronan is a great kid. He is two years old and loves tractors and wants a blue truck. My second, is due in 5 weeks, can't wait to meet him. I also built a chair last fall (~October 2020) that I really enjoy relaxing in. I keep the chair in my workshop in a corner set aside on a rug with a boombox, cabinet, and a slice of an oak tree stump.

However, there was a time in my life when in consultation with my self, I went by other names.

**names[]**
r00k/root //May/June 2020, strategy/primary
ready/raz0r // summer 2020, check/execute
weilder/scribe //late summer 2020, echoboxing/skill
warrior-poet/king //fall 2020, heart/mind
counselor/ghost //winter 2020, self/calm
one //spring 2021

At any moment within the given timeframe, I represented one of either of the follwoing dualities of identity. So for the 'r00k/root' duality, I was only be expressing the 'r00k' identity while ignoring the 'root' identity (and vice versa) at any given time. The dualities and their timeframes represent a period in which I negotiated *with myself* on the Lonely Isle. The goal was to find a way to live **with the self**, *by the self*, <ins>for the self</ins>.

//to live with self is to have existential calm. to live by the self is to live willfully. to live <ins>for the self</ins> is to grow/change/become.
