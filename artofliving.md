# Overview & Purpose
Self-expression is the means by which *the internal processes for perceiving and defining one's self* are externalized, or made real in the world. Living, or *to be alive*, is a stream of externalizations over the course of a lifetime. At all times, living is an **expression of the self**, *by the self*, <ins>for the self</ins>. Therefore, living is art, or an application of human creative skill and imagination. 

a life lived is a magnum opus. //greatest work of art in a lifetime, most important of any work. 'work' refers to a means of self-expression that exhibits a value or combination of values. 

Other opuses: //an externalization that exhibits a value
* work of kindness
* work of gratitude
* work of love
* work of skill
* work of art
* work of...

# Existential Calm & the [Isle[0]](identityisle.md)

**Key Topics**
* As a state of 'readiness', existential calm parries for the mind and for the body. The combination of the knowledge that 1) 'I am alive' and 2) 'I will end' equips an identity to understand the 'here' and 'now' as it relates to the self //life always good because at minimum, its good to be alive.
* I know who and what I am. //I am a living being and life is a binary state (*incomplete* before *complete*), I have (possess) life
* I am because I live.  //Life is good because i am alive (judgement) //if time has value AND life is measurable by time (duration), then life, at minimum, has one value as a measurement of 'time' as it relates to a life (ie time of BEGIN iteration).
* This is enough information to start to understand the present, or to leave the Isle[0].

**Why am I here (on the Isle[0])?**

* I am equipped with the judgement that 'Life is good', the knowledge that I will die, and the observation that I am alive. 
* While the *judgement* that 'Life is good' does not provide full assurance, the fact remains that I *will* continue to live on with or without assurance.
* The simplest explanation for "Why am I here?"  is that 'I have life' and 'Life is good' because life (all life) exists for itself (for *good*), by itself (for *good*).

**Why is it good?**
* Because the existence of life means that 'this' is not empty. //each life ultimately 'something from nothing.' simplification for universal causation
* Because a life is an opportunity. Life is time and moments are opporunitites. //time has value
* Because life is slow and tributary. each life is a component within the unison of Life. //life has universal scope

# Self-Expression and Externalization //c = 1 - 1.618, so c = -0.618 (or c = -1/ϕ)

**Main points**
* Identity is incalcuable in the absence of the self (ϕ). //see BEGIN iteration, self is undefined (c = 1 - *undefined*)
* In this way, identity becomes an expression of the self due to the fact that the self is necessary to produce an identity. //'identity' as a product of an equation for the self. 'identity' as a snapshot of the self. 
* So self-expression is the manifestation of the self for an identity. the self can be expressed in words and actions (externalization).

**Key Topics**
* The relationship between 'self' and 'identity'
* The 'self' as an engine for identity //the self generates identity (snapshots of the self in time)

**What does it mean that c = -1/ϕ?**
* At any point in time, identity is being expressed through externalizations of the self. this also means that each expression of the identity is limited by the means of externalization. 
* In the Golden Ratio calculations, it is shown that variable answers to the question "Who are you?" (*self-definitions*) have the value of 1/ϕ and are contextual. it may be that the value of -1/ϕ is the contextual value of the self (*self-concept*).  identity (-1/ϕ), and by extension all self expression, is the contextual externalization of self-concept. //explanation for |-1/ϕ|, context reduces the value of self-percpetion due to limitations inherent to the means of externalization. //needs clarification

**Why is it negative?**
* Self-perception is an internal process first. The value of variable answers *a, b* in the equation for the sense of self are shown to be positive values used to conceive one's self (internal process). identity is a negative value because it is the externalization of an internal process, or an inverse of the internal process of concept, which can be shown to be composed of positive value. //positive to negative, internal to external, self concept limited to context
* What ever the means of externalization, the self that is being expressed is a *reflection* of the self, or how the self is conceived.

# Oneness

**The Vision** //when perception and reality match (are equal). 1 = 1 or 1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ
* EXTERNAL: "I am" has the meaning that "I am a living being in reality" //"in reality" because reality is implied in the context of either *a* or *b* in the equation for ϕ and, therefore, the context of "I am" must be reality also. More specifically, "Who are you?" and "Who am I?" (contained in the equation for ϕ) are observable events.
* INTERNAL: The combination of the value of self (ϕ) and the value of self-expression (-1/ϕ) represents the ideal vision for the self based upon how it conceives and expresses itself in real-time (present-reality). The ideal vision is how each self wants to be and how the self is expressed. *Oneness* is when the combination of sense of self (perceptions/definitions of self) and self-expression (externalization) are equal to reality. //1 *as reality* = ϕ *as self* - 1/ϕ (externalization) 
* Peace is found in the balance of reality and perception (of the self).


# Questions for Self

**Key Topics**
* Who am I?  //Who you are is based on how you perceive yourself and define your self to others. Consider the core values and traits that are necessary to those identifications and why you chose those identifications in the first place.
* Why am I here? //that is a question that can only be answered by the asker. however, the question "What can I *do*?" is more relevant in any given situation. this question gives direction/purpose through ability ("What *can* I do?"). "Why am I here?" is seeking contextless direction/purpose, any answer will not change the fact that you are here and you *need* to do something so "What *can* I *do*?" becomes more relevant.
* What do I do with my life?  //start with: what does the end of my life look like? and work backwards. How do you get there and what can you do now to get there? (direction)
* Who do I choose to spend time with? //'shared consciousness' as a relationship between two or more persons, where is the greatest positive overlap?
* What happens when I die?  //the loop of 'a life' completes. a birth at the beginning and a death at the end. birth and death are like two book ends and each life is composed of the stories in between.

# Narrative

## A long conversation with Death

For the greater part of my life, I had no respect for my self mentally or physically. I was a untethered alcoholic and a wayward mind lost amid the numbness of intoxication and apathy and hatred. 

The first time I harmed myself was when I was in middle school. I locked the bathroom door and heated up an old coin I had saved from a trip to Ireland with my family sometime around 2000 and 2001. I used a lighter to heat the coin up as hot as I could, and then i pressed the coin deep into my forearm. I repeated on the other arm so that they were symetrical. I don't remember now why I did this, but this behavior was a harbinger of things to come. It was a manifestation of my self-loathing and disregard for my body. Once alcohol was introduced into my life a few years later, I had found a more concealed and tolerated form of self-destruction.

A year or two after graduating from college, I attended a party at a friend's 'river house'. I attended but was unwelcome, as I had spent the previous decade externalizing my malcontent by drinking to excess and treating others as colateral, simply as conduits for my own self-satisfaction. I was unwelcome but I needed an excuse to drink, so I found myself at the party. I realized that night that I was an alcoholic and that i was on a path that would lead to the early end of a squandered life. I left the party and walked over to the bank of the river and looked down. I was trying to figure out the ideal position to land on the rocks and stumps and debris below in order to break my neck and end my life. A simple explanation for the death, an alcoholic fell off of a ledge and died as a result of injuries sustained. I walked away and back to the ledge a few times. I closed my eyes and stood with my toes over the edge and my eyes closed, feeling the cool, damp air on my face. I stepped back and went back into the party and drank.

In the summer of 2018, I attempted suicide in my garage. I had been battling with my self for many years, and had found success in sobriety. The support of my wife and family made that possible and I struggle to show them what that means to me. I had been sober for about 9 months, but I drank a gallon of wine when I found out my wife was pregnant. How can I be a father? How can guide someone while I am still trying to guide my self through trials? I went into the garage and got an extension cord, secured it to the celing, and stood on a stool. With tears in my eyes, I tied a slipknot and put it around my neck and told myself that I just wanted to know how it feels. I took one foot off of the stool and felt the pressure on my neck. I asked God for the strength to carry on. I took the noose off and stepped off the stool. I wrapped the extension cord back up and put the stool back in its place. I went back inside. My wife cooked dinner and brought it to me as I sobered up on the couch.

The desire to kill myself has departed from me entirely now. I want to live because I believe 'Life is good' and that the time left to me in this world has value.

## Trust

I am unable to think of anyone I trust completely and few I trust partially. I struggle with paranoia. I am unable to reveal my self to others for fear that they will use the information against me. I am suspicious of people and so I interpret simple statements and gestures from others as hidden and malicious. I am overly sensitive to perceived insults and criticism. I have very few friends and many relationships in my life are stunted due to my inability to trust.

I have little to no interest in forming friendships or repairing damaged relationships. I struggle to see the purpose of social interaction because I believe it is rife with opportunity to be exploited or to be condemned.

Trust has value in social interations. It is the currency by which we exchange ideas and acheive mutual growth. Consdier the old miser with his gold piled high, what is the value of gold when it is scurried away into a dark room?

## The Root of Trust

Life is good. 

If you are alive, then that is good.

If you believe that *to be alive* is good, then you are ready (to live).

I *hope to trust* and *trust in hope*. I beleive that it is good to be alive.

## Water as a *Star* for Oneness //star as guide

Water is an amazing substance for its properties. Water is old, older than life itself. Truly, life would not have appeared on Earth without the presence of water. Without water, you would perish in a matter of days. Life *at large* and *your* life are bound inextricably to water. 

Over time, water changes its form but not its composition. It is backward- and forward- compatible, meaning that water can change from one form to another ceaselessly without any loss to its essence. Water is water, in whatever form. 

The sound of water, washing over stone or crashing against the shore is an old sound. Even before their were ears to hear, the sound of water filled the empty spaces of the world. That sound has not changed, because water has not changed.

Water can flow or it can crash. It fills any vessel it is poured into. It can be deep or shallow. Who can say whether the work of frosts, dews, waves, or rain are for good or for evil in the end? 

Water is reflective and cohesive. Water is natural and resilient to the long and slow wearing of time. It envelopes a pebble the same it envelopes a boulder as both sink to the bottom. And at the surface, water responds in measure to the force of the mass cast into it as it disperses the energy as ripples and waves and sound.

//A ship can float on water, but it can also sink.

* water has value *as an ideal*. an ideal is some thing to emulate in thoughts and action, as an analogy for action and a method acheive oneness
* water exists and it is a foundational element of our reality. it is also an ideal.
* water is old and tributary. who can say how and when water is complete? //binary state of incomplete/complete. water is incomplete because cannot define an end. always moving

## Properties of Water

* Water is polar. Water molecules are polar, with partial positive charges on the hydrogens, a partial negative charge on the oxygen, and a bent overall structure. This is because oxygen is more electronegative, meaning that it is better than hydrogen at attracting electrons.
* Water is an excellent solvent. Water has the unique ability to dissolve many polar and ionic substances. This is important to all living things because, as water travels through the water cycle, it takes many valuable nutrients along with it!
* Water has high heat capacity. It takes a lot of energy to raise the temperature of a certain amount of water by a degree, so water helps with regulating temperature in the environment. For example, this property allows the temperature of water in a pond to stay relatively constant from day to night, regardless of the changing atmospheric temperature.
* Water has high heat of vaporization. Humans (and other animals that sweat) use water’s high heat of vaporization to cool off. Water is converted from its liquid form to steam when the heat of vaporization is reached. This is known as evaporative cooling.
* Water has cohesive and adhesive properties. Water molecules have strong cohesive forces due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with one another. Cohesive forces are responsible for surface tension, the tendency of a liquid’s surface to resist rupture when placed under tension or stress. Water also has adhesive properties that allow it to stick to substances other than itself. These cohesive and adhesive properties are essential for fluid transport in many forms of life. For example, they allow nutrients to be transported to the top of a tree against the force of gravity.
* Water is less dense as a solid than as a liquid. As water freezes, the molecules form a crystalline structure that spaces the molecules further apart than in liquid water. This means that ice is less dense than liquid water, which is why it floats. This property is important, as it keeps ponds, lakes, and oceans from freezing solid and allows life to continue to thrive under the icy surface.


## Introduction 
My name is Cullen Drummey and I have a sense of self and a sense of time. These senses are a means for an anyone to interpret and understand the world that is happening around them. When equipped with both senses, someone is capable of knowing themselves, understanding others, and perceiving the world around them (reality). //vehicles for the real-time perception of reality

*I* am because *I* exist.

My sense of self and my sense of time were lost to me due to preventable circumstances. However, I restored these senses by defining an identity for myself and remaining true to my self. I believe that so much of life is about timing and measure when acting or speaking. 

For as long as I can remember, two conditions have existed on all things as it relates to my sense of self and how I interact with the world. //true twice and observable

However, there was a time in my life when I went by other names.

**self[]** //dualities of self 2013-2021

All listen to music.

* r00k + root //May/June 2020, strategy with intent
* ready + raz0r // summer 2020, good with truth
* wielder + scribe //late summer 2020, power with understanding
* warrior-poet + king //fall 2020, skill with choice
* counselor + ghost //winter 2020, guidance with knowledge
* one //spring 2021, oneness

**flow a: root -> ready -> scribe -> warrior-poet -> ghost (ϕ)**

**flow b: r00k -> raz0r -> wielder -> king -> counselor (-1/ϕ)**

**one = ϕ + (-1/ϕ) OR one = ϕ - 1/ϕ**

At any moment within the given timeframe, I represented one of either of the follwoing dualities of identity. So for the 'r00k/root' duality, I was only expressing the 'r00k' identity while ignoring the 'root' identity (and vice versa) at any given time. The dualities and their timeframes represent a period in which I negotiated *with myself* on the Isle[0]. The goal was to find a way to live **with the self**, *by the self*, <ins>for the self</ins>.

//to live with self is to have existential calm. to live by the self is to live willfully. to live <ins>for the self</ins> is to grow/change/become.

# A CROSS, THREE STARS, AND THE RABBIT 

## 07/16/2020 (Dusk)
In the receding sunlight on a grassy opening, I was at the end of a particularly difficult stretching session. I had just spoken the words, "Life is good. Now you see that which I see. That which was already there." Nearing exhaustion, I looked up through the sweat and saw a small brown rabbit staring back at me. It was at the edge of the treeline around 10 feet away.

## 03/27/21 ~22:00
In pale moonlight on in the dunes on the Eastern Shore, I ended another particulary difficult stretching session. It was a clear night, so clear that one could navigate easily only in the light of the moon and stars. I had just spoke the words, "Always remember who and what you are." I was facing West and looked up. I saw the lights of three stars in a straight line and spoke their names fom top to bottom. "Pollux. Alhena. Betelgeuse."

## 04/16/2021 21:58
During a studio session, I was brought to speech with the thought, "the highest outcome for the self is to communicate and to understand." In addition to the literal meaning, this statement also suggests that it is through communication with others that we are able to understand our selfs.

On the walk back from the garage to my office, I glimpsed a large cross on the neighbors porch. I looked at it for a moment and then I spoke the word "Hello" and smiled. I turned West and looked up. "Pollux. Alhena. Betelgeuse." About 20 feet away, I spotted a small brown rabbit on the edge of my driveway. I got down on my knees and lifted my arms to the sky because I knew it was an answer.
