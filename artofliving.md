Why a foundation for reason? //Once an answer to 'Who am I?' is established, the question 'What am I?' naturally follows because an explanation is required for how or *in what manner* an identity exists in reality. The answer to the question 'What am I?' serves as the foundation for reason because the answer meaningfully connects an identity to reality.

Life is good. //existential calm (i know who and what i am), abstract idea/a belief that is widely agreed upon.

**Why is it good?** //simplificiation, 'good' refers to anything not negative/bad

Because the existence of life means that 'this' is not empty. //each life ultimately 'something from nothing.' simplification for universal causation

Because a life is an opportunity. Life is time and moments are opporunitites. //time has value

Because life is slow and tributary. each life is a component within the unison of Life. //life has universal scope

**The Lonely Isle** //existential angst, what can be known/believed in the absence of another?

Imagine yourself, alone on a desert island seeking the unknown. ultimately, what is knowable is what is observable on the island. its observable that you are alive. so far so good.

# Self Expression and Externalization //c = 1 - 1.618, so c = -0.618 (or c = -1/ϕ)
identity is incalcuable in the absence of the self (ϕ). //see BEGIN iteration, self is undefined

identity is ultimately the greatest expression for the self. the self can also be expressed in words and actions.

# artofliving
How? themes. Life is good. //existential calm

by what thoughts and devices do you live your life? how do the themes you chose for yourself express themselves?
