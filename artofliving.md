# Overview & Purpose
The following are the conclusions and judgements that can be made based on the [identity equations](whoiam.md) while in the absence of other knowledge. The inferences inherent in the BEGIN and END iterations provide a foundation for understanding the self and its place in the world. Self-expression is the means by which *the internal processes for perceiving and defining one's self* are externalized, or made real in the world. Living is a stream of externalizations over the course of a lifetime. At all times, living is an **expression of the self**, *by the self*, <ins>for the self</ins>. Therefore, living is art, or an application of human creative skill and imagination. 

a life lived is a magnum opus. //greatest work of art in a lifetime, most important of any work. 'work' refers to an externalization of self.

other opuses: //an externalization that exhibits a value
work of kindness //
work of gratitude
work of love
work of skill
work of...

# a foundation for reason
every cause is an effect and every effect is a cause. //in development

# universal truth, or a common good
**Why is a common good necessary?**
* Once an answer to 'Who am I?' is established, the question 'What am I?' naturally follows because an explanation is needed for *how* or *in what manner* an identity exists in reality. The answer to the question 'What am I?' serves as the foundation for understanding the self because the answer meaningfully connects an identity to reality. What am I? --> 'I am a living being.' --> Life -at minimum- is good.
* Life is good. //existential calm, or i know who and what i am. i conceive my self and understand how my self exists in reality and therefore can begin to make sense of the world around me. 'good' is a judgment about the binary state of existence of 'i am alive'. the judgement is universal because the only alternative is 'i am not alive' which any reasonable person would percieve as 'not good' or 'bad'.
* a shared consciousness is created whenever there is shared knowledge (truth or belief) between two or more individuals. for example, two people have a shared consciousness when they have shared the same experience (ie truth, actual event) or when they believe the same thing (ie belief, government/religion/choice). So, a common good (*universally true AND good*) has the potential to be the foundation of a universally true shared consciouness.

**The Lonely Isle** //existential angst, what can be known/believed in the absence of another?

* Imagine yourself, alone on a desert island seeking the unknown. 
* ultimately, what is knowable is what is observable on the island. 
* its observable that you are alive, a living being. //because living is a binary state, only one alternative exists. any reasonable person would agree that being alive is better than being dead. (good > bad, alive > not alive)
* with the judgement that 'life is good', existential angst converts to existential calm. //I am because I live. the END iteration shows that an end for self is inevitable, so it is good to be alive when it is always true that 'i will end'. the BEGIN iteration shows that 'i am alive'. 

**Existential Calm**

* as a state of 'readiness', existential calm parries for the mind and for the body. the combination of the knowledge that 1) 'i am alive' and 2) 'i will end' equips an identity to understand their position in the depth of time (long time) and the shortness of life //life always good because at minimum, its good to be alive.
* i know who and what i am. //i am a living being and life is a binary state
* I am because I live.  //life is good because i am alive (judgement)


**Why is it good?** //simplificiation, 'good' refers to anything not negative/bad

* Because the existence of life means that 'this' is not empty. //each life ultimately 'something from nothing.' simplification for universal causation
* Because a life is an opportunity. Life is time and moments are opporunitites. //time has value
* Because life is slow and tributary. each life is a component within the unison of Life. //life has universal scope

# Self-Expression and Externalization //c = 1 - 1.618, so c = -0.618 (or c = -1/ϕ)
**main points**
* identity is incalcuable in the absence of the self (ϕ). //see BEGIN iteration, self is undefined (c = 1 - *undefined*)
* in this way, identity becomes an expression of the self due to the fact that the self is necessary to produce an identity. //'identity' as a product of an equation for the self. 'identity' as a snapshot of the self. 
* so self-expression is the manifestation of the self for an identity. the self can be expressed in words and actions (externalization).

**What does it mean that c = -1/ϕ?**
* at any point in time, identity is being expressed through externalizations of the self. this also means that each expression of the identity is limited by the means of externalization. 
* in the Golden Ratio calculations, it is shown that variable answers to the question "Who are you?" (*self-definitions*) have the value of 1/ϕ and are contextual. it may be that the value of -1/ϕ is the contextual value of the self (*self-concept*).  identity (-1/ϕ), and by extension all self expression, is the contextual externalization of self-concept. //explanation for |-1/ϕ|, context reduces the value of self-percpetion due to limitations inherent to the means of externalization. //needs clarification

**Why is it negative?**
* Self-perception is an internal process first. The value of variable answers *a, b* in the equation for the sense of self are shown to be positive values used to conceive one's self (internal process). identity is a negative value because it is the externalization of an internal process, or an inverse of the internal process of concept, which can be shown to be composed of positive value. //positive to negative, internal to external, self concept limited to context
* what ever the means of externalization, the self that is being expressed is a *reflection* of the self, or how the self is conceived.

# A Conversation with Death 
* Why? //cannot know life without first understanding death
* when the self encounters death, death asks two questions in sequence. "are you ready?" and "are you willing?" 
* a 'yes' and a 'yes' signals the end of the identity //a master of fate, by fate mastered
* a 'yes' and a 'no' signals the embrace of life //no fear of death and the choice to live
* a 'no' signals fear of death //"are you ready?"

**Are you ready?**

* if yes, proceed. //'ready' is a state of mind, existential calm. life is good and death is a part of each life, death must also be good *in some manner*.
* if no, wait. //to wait is to dread

**Are you willing?**
* for most, the answer is 'no' //there are only a few things someone may be willing to die for
* the fact remains that the answer 'yes' is utlimately a choice a self is *able* to make. //cases where willingness to die exists: suicide, honor (war), love (romeo and juliet), conviction (personal truth, a cause)
* this question highlights the value of ability and intent //the ability to end exists for the self, but the self must have intent in order to end.
* intent is a choice and ability is a means

# Identity as oneness or Identity as a multiple
* the 'I am' equation shows that oneness can be achieved for the self by devaluing the definitions assigned to one's self (recognizing external influence)
* split or multiple identities are a result of disproportionate valuations of the definitions for the self, which in turn distorts self-perception.
* split identities can be reintegrated by reassigning/recalculating the value of the definitions for the self. //re-proportion of self-perception value and the untrue definitions for the self

# Topics
* Who am I?  //Who you are is based on how you perceive yourself and define your self to others. Consider the core values and traits that are necessary to those identifications and why you chose those identifications in the first place.
* Why am I here? //that is a question that can only be answered by the asker. however, the question "What can I *do*?" is more relevant in any given situation. this question gives direction/purpose through ability ("What *can* I do?"). "Why am I here?" is seeking contextless direction/purpose, any answer will not change the fact that you are here and you *need* to do something so "What *can* I *do*?" becomes more relevant.
* What do I do with my life?  //start with: what does the end of my life look like? and work backwards. How do you get there and what can you do now to get there? (direction)
* Who do I choose to spend time with? //'shared consciousness' as a relationship between two or more persons, where is the greatest positive overlap?
* What happens when I die?  //the loop of 'a life' completes. a birth at the beginning and a death at the end. birth and death are like two book ends and each life is composed of the stories in between.

# artofliving
