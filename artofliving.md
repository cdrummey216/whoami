# Overview & Purpose
Self-expression is the means by which *the internal processes for perceiving and defining one's self* are externalized, or made real in the world. Living, or *to be alive*, is a stream of externalizations over the course of a lifetime. At all times, living is an **expression of the self**, *by the self*, <ins>for the self</ins>. Therefore, living is art, or an application of human creative skill and imagination. 

a life lived is a magnum opus. //greatest work of art in a lifetime, most important of any work. 'work' refers to a means of self-expression that exhibits a value or combination of values. 

Other opuses: //an externalization that exhibits a value
* work of kindness
* work of gratitude
* work of love
* work of skill
* work of art
* work of...

# Existential Calm & the [Isle[0]](identityisle.md)

**Key Topics**
* As a state of 'readiness', existential calm parries for the mind and for the body. The combination of the knowledge that 1) 'I am alive' and 2) 'I will end' equips an identity to understand the 'here' and 'now' as it relates to the self //life always good because at minimum, its good to be alive.
* I know who and what I am. //I am a living being and life is a binary state (*incomplete* before *complete*), I have (possess) life
* I am because I live.  //Life is good because i am alive (judgement) //if time has value AND life is measurable by time (duration), then life, at minimum, has one value as a measurement of 'time' as it relates to a life (ie time of BEGIN iteration).
* This is enough information to start to understand the present, or to leave the Isle[0].

**Why am I here (on the Isle[0])?**

* I am equipped with the judgement that 'Life is good', the knowledge that I will die, and the observation that I am alive. 
* While the *judgement* that 'Life is good' does not provide full assurance, the fact remains that I *will* continue to live on with or without assurance.
* The simplest explanation for "Why am I here?"  is that 'I have life' and 'Life is good' because life (all life) exists for itself (for *good*), by itself (for *good*).

**Why is it good?**
* Because the existence of life means that 'this' is not empty. //each life ultimately 'something from nothing.' simplification for universal causation
* Because a life is an opportunity. Life is time and moments are opporunitites. //time has value
* Because life is slow and tributary. each life is a component within the unison of Life. //life has universal scope

# Self-Expression and Externalization //c = 1 - 1.618, so c = -0.618 (or c = -1/ϕ)

**Main points**
* Identity is incalcuable in the absence of the self (ϕ). //see BEGIN iteration, self is undefined (c = 1 - *undefined*)
* In this way, identity becomes an expression of the self due to the fact that the self is necessary to produce an identity. //'identity' as a product of an equation for the self. 'identity' as a snapshot of the self. 
* So self-expression is the manifestation of the self for an identity. the self can be expressed in words and actions (externalization).

**Key Topics**
* The relationship between 'self' and 'identity'
* The 'self' as an engine for identity //the self generates identity (snapshots of the self in time)

**What does it mean that c = -1/ϕ?**
* At any point in time, identity is being expressed through externalizations of the self. this also means that each expression of the identity is limited by the means of externalization. 
* In the Golden Ratio calculations, it is shown that variable answers to the question "Who are you?" (*self-definitions*) have the value of 1/ϕ and are contextual. it may be that the value of -1/ϕ is the contextual value of the self (*self-concept*).  identity (-1/ϕ), and by extension all self expression, is the contextual externalization of self-concept. //explanation for |-1/ϕ|, context reduces the value of self-percpetion due to limitations inherent to the means of externalization. //needs clarification

**Why is it negative?**
* Self-perception is an internal process first. The value of variable answers *a, b* in the equation for the sense of self are shown to be positive values used to conceive one's self (internal process). identity is a negative value because it is the externalization of an internal process, or an inverse of the internal process of concept, which can be shown to be composed of positive value. //positive to negative, internal to external, self concept limited to context
* What ever the means of externalization, the self that is being expressed is a *reflection* of the self, or how the self is conceived.

# Questions for Self

**Key Topics**
* Who am I?  //Who you are is based on how you perceive yourself and define your self to others. Consider the core values and traits that are necessary to those identifications and why you chose those identifications in the first place.
* Why am I here? //that is a question that can only be answered by the asker. however, the question "What can I *do*?" is more relevant in any given situation. this question gives direction/purpose through ability ("What *can* I do?"). "Why am I here?" is seeking contextless direction/purpose, any answer will not change the fact that you are here and you *need* to do something so "What *can* I *do*?" becomes more relevant.
* What do I do with my life?  //start with: what does the end of my life look like? and work backwards. How do you get there and what can you do now to get there? (direction)
* Who do I choose to spend time with? //'shared consciousness' as a relationship between two or more persons, where is the greatest positive overlap?
* What happens when I die?  //the loop of 'a life' completes. a birth at the beginning and a death at the end. birth and death are like two book ends and each life is composed of the stories in between.

# Narrative

## Topics
* a
* b
* c

My name is Cullen Drummey and I have a sense of self and a sense of time. These senses are a means for an anyone to interpret and understand the world that is happening around them. When equipped with both senses, someone is capable of knowing themselves, understanding others, and perceiving the world around them (reality). //vehicles for the real-time perception of reality

*I* am because *I* exist.

My sense of self and my sense of time were lost to me due to preventable circumstances. However, I restored these senses by defining an identity for myself and remaining true to my self. I believe that so much of life is about timing and measure when acting or speaking. 

For as long as I can remember, two conditions have existed on all things as it relates to my sense of self and how I interact with the world. //true twice and observable

However, there was a time in my life when I went by other names.

**self[]** //dualities of self 2013-2021

All listen to music.

* r00k + root //May/June 2020, strategy with intent
* ready + raz0r // summer 2020, good with truth
* wielder + scribe //late summer 2020, power with understanding
* warrior-poet + king //fall 2020, skill with choice
* counselor + ghost //winter 2020, guidance with knowledge
* one //spring 2021, oneness

**flow a: root -> ready -> scribe -> warrior-poet -> ghost (ϕ)**

**flow b: r00k -> raz0r -> wielder -> king -> counselor (-1/ϕ)**

**one = ϕ + (-1/ϕ) OR one = ϕ - 1/ϕ**

At any moment within the given timeframe, I represented one of either of the follwoing dualities of identity. So for the 'r00k/root' duality, I was only expressing the 'r00k' identity while ignoring the 'root' identity (and vice versa) at any given time. The dualities and their timeframes represent a period in which I negotiated *with myself* on the Isle[0]. The goal was to find a way to live **with the self**, *by the self*, <ins>for the self</ins>.

//to live with self is to have existential calm. to live by the self is to live willfully. to live <ins>for the self</ins> is to grow/change/become.

# A CROSS, THREE STARS, AND THE RABBIT 

## 07/16/2020 (Dusk)
In the receding sunlight on a grassy opening, I was at the end of a particularly difficult stretching session. I had just spoken the words, "Life is good. Now you see that which I see. That which was already there." Nearing exhaustion, I looked up through the sweat and saw a small brown rabbit staring back at me. It was at the edge of the treeline around 10 feet away.

## 03/27/21 ~22:00
In pale moonlight on in the dunes on the Eastern Shore, I ended another particulary difficult stretching session. It was a clear night, so clear that one could navigate easily only in the light of the moon and stars. I had just spoke the words, "Always remember who and what you are." I was facing West and looked up. I saw the lights of three stars in a straight line and spoke their names fom top to bottom. "Pollux. Alhena. Betelgeuse."

## 04/16/2021 21:58
During a studio session, I was brought to speech with the thought, "the highest outcome for the self is to communicate and to understand." In addition to the literal meaning, this statement also suggests that it is through communication with others that we are able to understand our selfs.

On the walk back from the garage to my office, I glimpsed a large cross on the neighbors porch. I looked at it for a moment and then I spoke the word "Hello" and smiled. I turned West and looked up. "Pollux. Alhena. Betelgeuse." About 20 feet away, I spotted a small brown rabbit on the edge of my driveway. I got down on my knees and lifted my arms to the sky because I knew it was an answer.
