Why a foundation for understanding? //Once an answer to 'Who am I?' is established, the question 'What am I?' naturally follows because an explanation is required for how or *in what manner* an identity exists in reality. The answer to the question 'What am I?' serves as the foundation for understanding the self because the answer meaningfully connects an identity to reality.

Life is good. //existential calm (i know who and what i am), abstract idea/a belief that is widely agreed upon.

**Why is it good?** //simplificiation, 'good' refers to anything not negative/bad

Because the existence of life means that 'this' is not empty. //each life ultimately 'something from nothing.' simplification for universal causation

Because a life is an opportunity. Life is time and moments are opporunitites. //time has value

Because life is slow and tributary. each life is a component within the unison of Life. //life has universal scope

**The Lonely Isle** //existential angst, what can be known/believed in the absence of another?

Imagine yourself, alone on a desert island seeking the unknown. ultimately, what is knowable is what is observable on the island. its observable that you are alive. so far so good. //the END iteration shows that an end for self is inevitable, so it is good to be alive when it is always true that 'i will end'.

# Self Expression and Externalization //c = 1 - 1.618, so c = -0.618 (or c = -1/ϕ)
identity is incalcuable in the absence of the self (ϕ). //see BEGIN iteration, self is undefined

identity is ultimately the greatest expression for the self. the self can also be expressed in words and actions.

# artofliving
Why 'art of living'? //because art is self expression and living is expressing oneself over a lifetime.

How? themes. Life is good. //existential calm

by what thoughts and devices do you live your life? how do the themes you chose for yourself express themselves?
