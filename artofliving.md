# a foundation for reason
every cause is an effect and every effect is a cause. //in development

# a foundation for understanding
Why a foundation for understanding? //Once an answer to 'Who am I?' is established, the question 'What am I?' naturally follows because an explanation is needed for *how* or *in what manner* an identity exists in reality. The answer to the question 'What am I?' serves as the foundation for understanding the self because the answer meaningfully connects an identity to reality. What am I? --> 'I am a living being.' --> Life -at minimum- is good.

Life is good. //existential calm, or i know who and what i am. i conceive my self and understand how my self exists in reality and therefore can begin to make sense of the world around me. 'good' is a judgment about the binary state of existence of 'i am alive'. the judgement is universal because the only alternative is 'i am not alive' which any reasonable person would percieve as 'not good' or 'bad'.

**The Lonely Isle** //existential angst, what can be known/believed in the absence of another?

Imagine yourself, alone on a desert island seeking the unknown. ultimately, what is knowable is what is observable on the island. its observable that you are alive, a living being. with the judgement that 'life is good', existential angst converts to existential calm and reason/rationalization is clear. //the END iteration shows that an end for self is inevitable, so it is good to be alive when it is always true that 'i will end'. (good > bad, alive > not alive). the BEGIN iteration shows that 'i am alive'.

**Why is it good?** //simplificiation, 'good' refers to anything not negative/bad

* Because the existence of life means that 'this' is not empty. //each life ultimately 'something from nothing.' simplification for universal causation
* Because a life is an opportunity. Life is time and moments are opporunitites. //time has value
* Because life is slow and tributary. each life is a component within the unison of Life. //life has universal scope

# Self Expression and Externalization //c = 1 - 1.618, so c = -0.618 (or c = -1/ϕ)
identity is incalcuable in the absence of the self (ϕ). //see BEGIN iteration, self is undefined

identity is ultimately the greatest expression for the self. the self can also be expressed in words and actions.

# artofliving
Why 'art of living'? //because art is self expression and living is expressing oneself over a lifetime.
