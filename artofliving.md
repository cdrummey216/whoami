Life is good. //existential calm

Why? //abstract idea/a belief that is widely agreed upon. 

Because the existence of life means that 'this' is not empty, so each life ultimately something from nothing. //simplification

Because a life is an opportunity. Life is time and moments are opporunitites.

Because life is slow and tributary, each life is a part of and contributes to the clamorous unison of Life.
