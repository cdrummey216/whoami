# Framing the World

'Framing the world' refers to the mental labor undertaken by an individual that is aimed at deciphering and integrating the truth that is available in the present moment. Who am I? What am I? How did I get here? What am I doing? 

'Framing the world' begins with the ultimate source of truth for an individual, which is their own identification. Truly, the ways in which someone identifies themselves flows naturally from their sense of self. Who can say whether individual's answer to 'Who am I?' and 'Who are you?' is untrue? If someone believes in the accuracy of their answer and it is also not contradicted by some other externalization of the self, then the answer is true.

I am who I say I am.

# A Method to Find Truth
Simple statements represent, at minimum, a single dimension of a topic. Statements like 'the sun will rise tomorrow' and 'the tide will ebb and flow' are simple characterizations of complex and aged processes in our world and their value lies in their truth about our world. Both statements will always be true, until such conditions appear that would disrupt them. The *value* of these statements resides in that they are always true. For example, the sun rose this morning and water flowed as the tide steadily washed out to sea. So, whether the sun rises over the sea or suddenly over mountaintops in to a deep valley, statements that desrcibe the manner in which the sun proceeds in the world around us will desrcibe an aspect of the truth that the sun rises and the tide flows. Statements that describe 'Where/When/How?' the sun rises are the 'scope' that is can be placed on universal truths because anwsers to questions like *How does it rise?* or *Where does it rise?* or *When does it rise?* about the sun or tide will yeild a statement about the manner in which the sun or tide proceeds in real-time.

Simple truths intersect with other truths to form complex relationships of true data points. The identity, who each person wants to be in the world, is composed of simple truths about ourselves. So, what do you want to be true about your self?

Universally true statements about a topic will always lead to more truth.
 
Does the "ideal self" only exist in the never-realized future?  Or is it Heaven?  Or something else?

When you envision your ideal self, who are you? What do you know and what do you say?

*That* is where oneness can be *found*. Harmonize your actions and thoughts now with your ideal self in order to *get there*.

The ideal self is the vision of the self that each individual has for themselves. How do you want to be understood? How do you want to communicate your self? Where is that person when you envision them? That person and that place is a waypoint that will guide your responses in real-time. Follow the guide long enough, and you will reach your ideal self. 

Once the ideal self is envisioned, the only task that remains is to achieve it in the time alotted to you.

* The ideal self is the vision of the self that each individual has for themselves. How do you want to be understood? How do you want to communicate your self? Where is that person when you envision them? That person and that place is a waypoint that will guide responses in real-time. Follow the guide long enough, and you will reach your ideal self.
* Heaven is peace outside the boundaries of real-time. The ideal self is a guide to find peace here and now. It can be realized and sustained by harmonizing the present self with the ideal self.
* The star is your ideal self and the sea is your present circumstance. If you know where you want to get to, you can make choices here and now that will get you there. I understand that there are those that don't know where they want to get to, but simple answers to simple questions is where anyone should start.
* Who am I? 
* What am I?

Imagine yourself as a ship at sea, the sounds of the waves surround you and above in the clear sky, you can see the stars innumerable. With one hand on the helm, you keep your eye fixed on a single star. A straight line can be traced from the tip of your bow, off the horizon. and upwards, until it reaches your star. You are determined and calm because you have a destination and the passion to get there. All you have to do is keep your eye on that star. 

A star can be something, anything, that acts as a waypoint for the self, or a guiding influence on the things we do, the things we think, and the things we say.

Do you perceive your sense of self? Are you *you*? To perceive our selves, we must perceive the world that we live in. To *perceive the world (real-time)* is to *frame the world around us*. *Framing* is to *understand* and *comprehend* the world in real-time. 

* The equation for identity (fc, c = 1 − ϕ) encapsulates who you are and what you are in real-time. When you are aware of the variable answers used in the formula for the self (a, b), you also understand what you are because the variable answers are data points about your self as you persist through time. What you are is a reflection of how you live in real-time, the things you think, do, say, speak and act. 
* The constant of proportionality for truth is important in variable answers, because untrue variable answers ultimately skew the concept of what you are.
* Simultaneously accepting who you are and knowing what you are aligns the present with the past and the future. If you accept who you are here and now and comprehend that what you are proceeds from the past, then what lies before you is the future.
* Together, they will dull the sharpness of the past (memory) and will cut a straight line to the future (anticipation).
* Who am I? I am a living being that perceives and defines itself.
* What am I? My nature is to understand and to communicate.
* How do you perceive your self? How do you define your self?
* What do you understand? What do you communicate?

## I exist (1), therefore I am (ϕ). //**fc, c = 1 − ϕ**

* The 'I exist' equation shows that I exist, so 'I am' because I must. 
* The 'I exist' equation is part of the identity equations, so this means that I can prove 'I am' on the Isle[0].
* Also put, I am because I exist.
* Also put, I exist, therefore I think, therefore I am.

### For You

Basically, if I can prove that I exist (with the identity equations) then I am because I must be.  
The identity equations showed, ultimately, that 'I exist' via oneness (1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ). So, when I can prove that _I exist_ using the 'I exist' equation, I know that _I am_ because I _must_ be. When I _also_ know who and what I am, I know existential calm and can externalize it. Oneness into being.

The self (ϕ) must be externalized in to reality (1) in order for it to exist in reality. The sense of self is the feeling of identity, uniqueness, and self-direction. It is an internal process, happening exclusively within each mind. Each mind, in turn, has the ability to externalize itself in the words spoken and the things done.

### For All

Each life is unique and independent while, at the same time, inextriably bound to other life.

Nothing will change the fact that I am *here now*, so *I am* because *I* am here alive now. And I know I exist. //'I exist' equation

Nothing will change the fact that I am here now *with you* and that you are here now with me. And that time goes on. And life flows. 

## Propositional Mathematics

The self is produced by the combination of how we understand our selves in the world and how we define our selves to others. To understand our selves,  Aby asking "Who am I?" Any answer to this question provides will not only provide some insight in to the repsonder's perception of the self, but it will also have some measure of value, or significance, to the responder. Likewise, we define our selves in the ways in which we communicate and interact with others in the world. When asked "Who are you?", the answer will define our selves in a way that is real because the question is external and our answer is a representation of our self.

## Definitions

* "Who am I?" is a question with a variable answer, or, a question that can be satisifed by an inumerable count of distinct answers. The response "I am the one who asked" is an example of an answer that is universally true. In other words, any individual at any time would be able to provide this answer and also satisfy the question.

* Other answers to this question could be responses like "I am a man" or "I am a florist", but these both have the potential for change. A man was once a child and a florist could sell their business. So, in this way, answers to the question "who am i?" are subject to change over time.

* Identifying as the one who asked positions the "asker" as an active participant in the curation of their identity. From this perspective, the individual has the ability to accept or reject a given answer at any time. If a routine of asking and answering "who am i?" is established, then each answer can be assessed individually or as a trend over time and used to distinguish desirable and undesirable attributes and qualities. When combined with a free will, this ability allows the "asker" to discover who they are, in thoughts and actions.

## Concentrated Philosophy

Imagine yourself, alone on a desert island, seeking the unknown. You are alone with only the sounds of the waves lapping against the shore. Ultimately, what is knowable about the world around you is what is observable on the island. It is observable that you are alive now. It is good to be alive.

### Conclusions from the Isle[0]

I am on the Isle[0] Isle and I am equipped with the knowledge that I will die someday (future) and the observation that I am alive (now).

* The time between now and the future (end) is what remains of your life. 'time' is a limited resource of life with scarcity for a given context. Therefore, time has value.
* I know I exist (I am) because I can observe that I am alive. it is observable that 'this' is not empty, because I exist (now). Therefore, 'this' is not empty because I exist now.
* It will be observable that life compounds over time, building upon itself. Each life (living being) is an event that has begun but not yet ended, or an incomplete event. The binary state of complete/incomplete describes a chronological state, whereby an incomplete state must precede the complete state. The incomplete state positions a living being at a point in time before its end (complete state) which the living being is progressing towards (in time). It is always true that each life will end. Therefore, Life is tributary to itself.

//The following are the conclusions and judgements that can be made based on the identity equations while in the absence of other knowledge. The inferences inherent in the BEGIN and END iterations provide a foundation for understanding the self and its place in the world. The BEGIN and END iteraions are limits ('floor', 'ceiling') on each life, such that there is a finite amount of time between either iteration. The time between the iterations is the duration of existence (life), which is perceived by the self through memory (stored memories in a sequence).

**Right now and anytime, I must choose and I must be.**

‘I must choose’ because the identity is a product of a free will. The choice inherent to a variable answer holds bearing on how we perceive and define our selves in the world. Unless we choose to end our selves early, we will continue living in real-time. 

*Is anything that "must be chosen" really a choice?*

* I must choose if I want to continue to live in real-time. 
* We live in the present, or real-time. Real-time is a continuous stream of stimuli that we must respond to in order to live and continue to live. The choice lies in how we respond at every moment.  
* A single alternative is always available that will end all choice. We can choose to die, which is the choice to preclude all other future choices. 'To preclude all other choices' is to void the requirement that we 'must choose'. So, we always have the ability to 'exit', which can be thought of as a universal choice that allows anyone to escape the 'must choose' requirement.
* To put it differently, if we are ready and we are willing, we can decide to 'not choose' anymore by making the final choice to end choice by ending our life. The END iteration and the Conversation with Death show that the end of life is a choice in some cases and that it is final in all cases.
* The only choice that is unavailable to us if we choose to live is the choice to ‘not choose’. In other words, we must respond to real-time in order to live.
* Foregoing the choice to die in any case is tantamount to choosing to live, because life and death are binary/exclusive. By choosing to not die, we are choosing to live.
* If we must choose how to respond to real-time, we should choose a response that reflects our ideal self. 

‘I must be (live)’ because the energy quotient will drive me ever onwards. The vision of my self that guides all my interactions. What I choose to eat, say, practice, make, do, believe, produce, cultivate, share and create will flow out from my self. And the vision will have a place, the special place in time where your ideal self exists.

‘Right now and anytime’ because we exist in real-time. The present exists, and everything else is either memory or anticipation. The present flows from the past and on into the future.

Oneness is a way to understand the self at any moment. Peace is found in understanding and accepting who and what you are at a given moment and how this moment fits into the chain of events that lead to your ideal self. The goal is to float towards your ideal self using the current of the river. Time is the current and reality is the river. 

When you understand that the equation for identity (fc, c = 1 - phi) is who you are, you also understand what you are. You are a living being that perceives and defines itself and your nature is to understand and to communicate.

The voyage of life begins at one point on the river and ends somewhere else downstream.

## Living as Art

*Living as art* is an approach to life that is distinguished by the credo that self-expression is the highest form of externalization for the individual. It is true that other forms of expression exist, such as the rhythm and measure born out of a musician's creativity or the unique skill of an painter's brushstroke. However, an instrument remains silent until handled by the musician and the brush lays idle until the painter returns. When self-expression is conceptualized as a medium for individual expression, the onus of responsibility to be who we want to be -- who we see in the vision of our self-- is ever at the fore of our minds. So, in any moment we engage with the world around us, whether we are welcoming home a loved one at the end of the day or completing a task at work, the awareness of our greatest selves acts as a waypoint, or star. 

### Self-expression

Self-expression is the means by which the internal processes for perceiving and defining one's self are externalized, or made real in the world. Living, or to be alive, is a stream of externalizations over the course of a lifetime. At all times, living is an expression of the self, by the self, for the self. Therefore, living is art, or an application of human creative skill and imagination.

a life lived is a magnum opus. //greatest work of art in a lifetime, most important of any work. 'work' refers to a means of self-expression that exhibits a value or combination of values.

Other opuses: //an externalization that exhibits a value
