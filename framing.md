# Framing the World
When you envision yourself, where are you? Within that vision of yourself, what do you know and what do you propose?

That place that you envision yourself, what ever the context (perception or reality), is where peace can be found. Harmonize your actions and thoughts in order to get there.

Imagine yourself as a ship at sea, the sounds of the waves surround you and above in the clear sky, you can see the stars innumerable. With one hand on the helm, you keep your eye fixed on a single star and a straight line can be traced from the tip of your bow, off the horizon and up, until it reaches your star. You are determined and calm because you have a destination and the passion to get there. All you have to do is keep your eye on that star. 

A star can be something, anything, that acts as a waypoint for the self, or a guiding influence on the things we do, the things we think, and the things we say.

## Propositional Mathematics

The self is produced by the combination of how we understand our selves in the world and how we define our selves to others. To understand our selves, we must first perceive our selves by framing the world around us by asking "Who am I?" Any answer to this question provides will not only provide some insight in to the repsonder's perception of the self, but it will also have some measure of value, or significance, to the responder. Likewise, we define our selves in the ways in which we communicate and interact with others in the world. When asked "Who are you?", the answer will define our selves in a way that is real because the question is external and our answer is a representation of our self.

## Definitions

* "Who am I?" is a question with a variable answer, or, a question that can be satisifed by an inumerable count of distinct answers. The response "I am the one who asked" is an example of an answer that is universally true. In other words, any individual at any time would be able to provide this answer and also satisfy the question.

* Other answers to this question could be responses like "I am a man" or "I am a florist", but these both have the potential for change. A man was once a child and a florist could sell their business. So, in this way, answers to the question "who am i?" are subject to change over time.

* Identifying as the one who asked positions the "asker" as an active participant in the curation of their identity. From this perspective, the individual has the ability to accept or reject a given answer at any time. If a routine of asking and answering "who am i?" is established, then each answer can be assessed individually or as a trend over time and used to distinguish desirable and undesirable attributes and qualities. When combined with a free will, this ability allows the "asker" to discover who they are, in thoughts and actions.

## Concentrated Philosophy

Imagine yourself, alone on a desert island, seeking the unknown. You are alone with only the sounds of the waves lapping against the shore. Ultimately, what is knowable about the world around you is what is observable on the island. It is observable that you are alive now. It is good to be alive.

### Conclusions from the Isle[0]

I am on the Isle[0] Isle and I am equipped with the knowledge that I will die someday (future) and the observation that I am alive (now).

* The time between now and the future (end) is what remains of your life. 'time' is a limited resource of life with scarcity for a given context. Therefore, time has value.
* I know I exist (I am) because I can observe that I am alive. it is observable that 'this' is not empty, because I exist (now). Therefore, 'this' is not empty because I exist now.
* It will be observable that life compounds over time, building upon itself. Each life (living being) is an event that has begun but not yet ended, or an incomplete event. The binary state of complete/incomplete describes a chronological state, whereby an incomplete state must precede the complete state. The incomplete state positions a living being at a point in time before its end (complete state) which the living being is progressing towards (in time). It is always true that each life will end. Therefore, Life is tributary to itself.

//The following are the conclusions and judgements that can be made based on the identity equations while in the absence of other knowledge. The inferences inherent in the BEGIN and END iterations provide a foundation for understanding the self and its place in the world. The BEGIN and END iteraions are limits ('floor', 'ceiling') on each life, such that there is a finite amount of time between either iteration. The time between the iterations is the duration of existence (life), which is perceived by the self through memory (stored memories in a sequence).

## Living as Art

*Living as art* is an approach to life that is distinguished by the credo that self-expression is the highest form of externalization for the individual. It is true that other forms of expression exist, such as the rhythm and measure born out of a musician's creativity or the unique skill of an painter's brushstroke. However, an instrument remains silent until handled by the musician and the brush lays idle until the painter returns. When self-expression is conceptualized as a medium for individual expression, the onus of responsibility to be who we want to be -- who we see in the vision of our self-- is ever at the fore of our minds. So, in any moment we engage with the world around us, whether we are welcoming home a loved one at the end of the day or completing a task at work, the awareness of our greatest selves acts as a waypoint, or star. 

### Self-expression

Self-expression is the means by which the internal processes for perceiving and defining one's self are externalized, or made real in the world. Living, or to be alive, is a stream of externalizations over the course of a lifetime. At all times, living is an expression of the self, by the self, for the self. Therefore, living is art, or an application of human creative skill and imagination.

a life lived is a magnum opus. //greatest work of art in a lifetime, most important of any work. 'work' refers to a means of self-expression that exhibits a value or combination of values.

Other opuses: //an externalization that exhibits a value
