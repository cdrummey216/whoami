## whoami
"Who am i?" is a question with a variable answer, or, a question that can be satisifed by an inumerable count of distinct answers.
The response "I am whoever asked" is an example of an answer that is universally true. In other words, any individual 
at any time would be able to provide this answer and also satisfy the question.

Other answers to this question could be responses like "I am a man" or "I am a florist", but these both have the potential for change. 
A man was once a child and a florist could sell their business. So, in this way, answers to the question "who am i?" are subject to change
over time.

Identifying as ***the one who asked*** positions the "asker" as an active participant in the curation of their identity. From this perspective,
the individual has the ability to accept or reject a given answer at any time. If a routine of asking and answering "who am i?" is 
established, then each answer can be assessed individually or as a trend over time and used to distinguish desirable and undesirable attributes and qualities.
When combined with a free will, this ability allows the "asker" to discover who they are, in thoughts and actions.

# AN ENGINE FOR IDENTITY 
This question, as a routine, is the engine for identity. ***The one who asks*** is seeking an answer and therefore possesses the power to accept or reject an answer. The routine becomes a reference point on which one can build their active identification, or, accummulate the things that they identify with.

# FREE WILL AND IDENTITY
The product of a free will is an identity. An identity is the culmination of an individual's choices for active identification,
or, the things that they choose to identify with. An identity is also an answer to the question "who am i?"

# TRUST AND BELIEF
In order to believe, one must trust. Trust is an active quality exchanged between identities because it can be given and recieved and it has social value. Trust is a foundational element of an identity. Trust is valuable because it is given and recieved by out of someone's own free will, a willful act. When trust is established, it facilitates social interaction between individuals. For example, an individual can, in a single exchange, grant their trust to and recieve 
the trust of another individual. Trust facilitates the exchange of ideas.

A belief is partial or full assurance without positive knowledge or absolute certainty. In order to believe in any one thing, an individual must grant their trust to that which they believe. So, in this way, belief becomes a product of free will through the act of choosing to grant trust. Trust is a foundational element of an
identity and is the currency of exchange between identities. 

# HUMAN NATURE
The human body, as a category, is the result the echo's progression through time (ie evolution). The mind 
and its processes of thought and feeling are tethered to reality by the body. Therefore, the physical 
mechanisms that are at the root of these processes are the lens through which humanity experiences reality.
Human nature, therefore, is a reflection of the echo. 

**Human nature is a duality and balance is the ideal.**
* Understand/Communicate
* Know/feel
* Order/harmony
* Love/Desire

# AN EXTERNAL FOUNDATION FOR KNOWLEDGE, OR "I"

I asked "who am I?", therefore I am.

By asking "who am I?", one has simultaneously taken an action that defines "I" and infers the existance of "I". "I" is
defined as "I am the one who asked" and "I" must exist because it can be defined.

Asking "who am I?" is a action that can be observed. Due to this fact, I can signal to another "I" (external identity) that I exist, and vice versa. The asker, at the moment of asking, will know that they are the asker because they identify as the asker with the knowledge that "I am the one who asked." Another individual could also hear the asker and determine that "I" (relative to the asker) exists because it can be defined.

# VARIABLE ANSWER
A variable answer is used to represent a response to a question that is infinite in scope so long as it acknowledges the inferences in the question. For example, "Who are you?" is a question that is satisfied by any answer from the responder that acknowledges the existance of "I" (*you*). In effect, this means that the responder will choose to define themselves because the choice in response is dependent upon the responder.

"Who are you?" is also a question that acknowledges the existance of another "I". A universal response to this question is "I am not the one who asked", the inverse of the variable answer "I am the one who asked." An additional universal response to this question is "I am," when "I" is understood to be the entirety of the identity.

Variable answers occur in pairs. For example, "I am a man" shares equal value, in context, to "I am not a man."

A variable answer that defines an identity is self-similar due to the fact that the identity it defines ("I") remains the same while being defined ("I am *x*."). At any scale, a variable answer is a representation of the identity. The initiator and generator concept from fractals is useful to describe variable answers. The initiator, or starting shape, is "I am" which represents the entirety of the identity. The generator, or scaled copy of the initiator, is the following descriptors or definitions that are appropriate given the context of the question.

# IDENTITY AS A FRACTAL SET
Each identity can be regarded as a fractal set, or a never ending pattern of variable answers in response to the question "Who are you?" or "Who am I?"
