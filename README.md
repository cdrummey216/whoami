## whoami
"Who am i?" is a question with a variable answer or a question that can be satisifed by an inumerable count of distinct answers.
The answer "I am whoever asked" is a unique example of an answer that is always true and universal. In other words, any individual 
at any time would be able to truthfully invoke this answer and satisfy the question.

Other answers to this question could be responses like "I am a man" or "I am a florist", but these both have the potential for change. 
A man was once a child and a florist could sell their business. So, in this way, answers to the question "who am i?" are subject to change
over time.

Identifying as the one who asked positions the "asker" as an active participant in the curation of their identity. Identifying as the "asker"
affords the individual the ability to accept or reject a given answer at any time. if a routine of asking and answering "who am i?" is 
established, then each answer can be inspected, compared, updated or modified given the specific requirements at a given time. When combined 
with a free will, this ability allows the "asker" to decide who they are, in thoughts and actions.

# AN ENGINE FOR IDENTITY 
This question, as a routine, is the engine for identity. it is the question that we must all answer over and over again throughout the course of our lives. 
we can be satisified with an answer at one time and desperate for a new answer at another time because we are the one that asked. the routine 
becomes a reference point on which one can build their active identification.

# FREE WILL AND IDENTITY
the product of a free will is an identity. an identity is the culmination of an agent's choices for active identification,
or, the things that they choose to identify with. an identity is also an answer to the question "who am i?"

# TRUST AND BELIEF
in order to believe, one must trust. trust is something that is given, a willful act.

a belief is partial or full assurance without positive knowledge or absolute certainty. 

in order to believe in any one thing, one only needs to grant their trust to that which they believe. so, in this way
belief becomes a product of free will through the act of choosing to grant trust. trust is a foundational element of an
identity and is the currency of exchange between identities. trust is an active quality that has value and can be given 
and recieved by an identity. for example, one individual can, in a single exchange, grant their trust to and recieve 
the trust of another individual. trust facilitates the exchange of ideas.

# HUMAN NATURE
the human body, as a category, is the result the echo's progression through time (ie evolution). the mind 
and its processes of thought and feeling are tethered to reality by the body. therefore, the physical 
mechanisms that are at the root of these processes are the lens through which humanity experiences reality.
human nature, therefore, is a reflection of the echo. 

human nature is a duality and balance is the ideal.
-understand/communicate
-know/feel
-order/harmony
-love/desire

# AN EXTERNAL FOUNDATION FOR KNOWLEDGE, OR "I"
"I asked "who am I?", therefore I am" because asking "who am I?" is a action that can be observed, 
which provides a certain foundation for knowledge external to the self. The asker can hear their 
voice and know that they are the asker. Another individual could also hear the asker and 
determine that "I" (relative to the asker) exists. 

by asking "who am i?", one has simultaneously taken an action that defines "I" and infers the existance of "I". "I" is
defined as "I am the one who asked" and "I" must exist because it can be defined.

Specifically, asking is defined as speaking the question "who am i?" such that the words can be heard and understood,
either by the asker or by another individual. The vocalization of the sounds is measurable and the meaning can be affirmed 
by another individual. Furthermore, the asker, at the moment of asking, will know that they are the asker because they 
identify as the asker.
