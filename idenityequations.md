# IDENTITY AS A CONCEPT
In order to be understood, identity and its components must be defined.

# WHO AM I?
"Who am I?" is a question with a variable answer, or, a question that can be satisifed by an inumerable count of distinct answers.
The response "I am the one who asked" is an example of an answer that is universally true. In other words, any individual 
at any time would be able to provide this answer and also satisfy the question.

Other answers to this question could be responses like "I am a man" or "I am a florist", but these both have the potential for change. 
A man was once a child and a florist could sell their business. So, in this way, answers to the question "who am i?" are subject to change
over time.

Identifying as ***the one who asked*** positions the "asker" as an active participant in the curation of their identity. From this perspective,
the individual has the ability to accept or reject a given answer at any time. If a routine of asking and answering "who am i?" is 
established, then each answer can be assessed individually or as a trend over time and used to distinguish desirable and undesirable attributes and qualities.
When combined with a free will, this ability allows the "asker" to discover who they are, in thoughts and actions.

# AN ENGINE FOR IDENTITY 
This question, as a routine, is the engine for identity. ***The one who asks*** is seeking an answer and therefore possesses the power to accept or reject an answer. The routine becomes a reference point on which one can build their active identification, or, accummulate the things that they identify with.

# FREE WILL AND IDENTITY
The product of a free will is an identity. An identity is the culmination of an individual's choices for active identification,
or, the things that they choose to identify with. An identity is also an answer to the question "Who am I?"

# TRUST AND BELIEF
In order to believe, one must trust. Trust is an active quality exchanged between identities because it can be given and recieved and it has social value. Trust is a foundational element of an identity. Trust is valuable because it is given and recieved by out of someone's own free will, a willful act. When trust is established, it facilitates social interaction between individuals. For example, an individual can, in a single exchange, grant their trust to and recieve 
the trust of another individual. Trust facilitates the exchange of ideas.

A belief is partial or full assurance without positive knowledge or absolute certainty. In order to believe in any one thing, an individual must grant their trust to that which they believe. So, in this way, belief becomes a product of free will through the act of choosing to grant trust. Trust is a foundational element of an
identity and is the currency of exchange between identities. 

# AN EXTERNAL FOUNDATION FOR KNOWLEDGE, OR "I"

I asked "Who am I?", therefore I am.

By asking "Who am I?", one has simultaneously taken an action that defines "I" and infers the existence of "I". "I" is
defined as "I am the one who asked" and "I" must exist because it can be defined.

Asking "Who am I?" is a action that can be observed. Due to this fact, I can signal to another "I" (external identity) that I exist, and vice versa. The asker, at the moment of asking, will know that they are the asker because they identify as the asker with the knowledge that "I am the one who asked." Another individual could also hear the asker and determine that "I" (relative to the asker) exists because it can be defined.

# VARIABLE ANSWER
A variable answer is used to represent a response to a question that is infinite in scope so long as it acknowledges the inferences in the question. For example, "Who are you?" is a question that is satisfied by any answer from the responder that acknowledges the existence of "I" (*you*). In effect, this means that the responder will choose to define themselves because the choice in response is dependent upon the responder. 

"Who are you?" is also a question that acknowledges the existence of another "I". A universal response to this question is "I am not the one who asked", the inverse of the variable answer "I am the one who asked." An additional universal response to this question is "I am," when "I" is understood to be the entirety of the identity.

Variable answers occur in inverse pairs. For example, "I am a man" shares equal value, in context, to "I am not a man." The value of a variable answer is determined by the identity it describes. For example, the value of the variable answer of "I am a student" differs between the PHD candidate and a child waiting for the recess bell. In this way, *the value of any variable answer is only relevant to the other variable answers describing the same identity.* In effect, this means that the "I" is the arbiter of their identity because values are assigned to variable answers by that arbiter.

A variable answer that defines an identity is self-similar due to the fact that the identity it defines ("I") remains the same while being defined ("I am *x*."). At any scale, a variable answer is a representation of the identity.

# IDENTITY AS A FRACTAL SET
Each identity can be regarded as a fractal set, or a never ending pattern of variable answers in response to the question "Who are you?" or "Who am I?"
 
# GOLDEN RATIO AND SENSE OF SELF
A calculation of the Golden Ratio (ϕ) using variable answers, or values for a,b from "Who am I?" and "Who are you?". 

The value of ϕ (1.618) is the result of an equation using two given values (a, b) that have specific properties in relation to each other. When these properties are present, the values are in the golden ratio. As it relates to the calculation of identity as a fractal set, the value of ϕ (1.618) is the ideal ratio for any two values for a, b. The necessary inputs to calculate identity as a fractal set are two true variable answers for *a* and *b*. Analogous to the golden ratio is the constant for proportionality, which is the ratio between two directly proportional values.

* a+b/a = ϕ AND a/b = ϕ //(1) property of ϕ
* a > b > 0 //(2) property of ϕ, the scope of *a* is greater than the scope of *b* (*a > b > 0*)
* a+b is to a as a is to b. //(3) property of ϕ
* **ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ** //(4) property of ϕ,  ϕ can be used to define itself (method #1).
* **ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/ϕ** //(5) property of ϕ,  ϕ can be used to define itself (method #2).
* a = A variable answer to "Who am I?", gives contextual truth for b, provides the limiting scope for b
* b = A variable answer to "Who are you?"
* a+b = A combination of a and b
* a, b must be true in order to be proportional to each other //proportional as it relates to "I", the scope of a must be greater than b and b must be greater than 0 (zero or nothing)

# PROPERTIES OF ϕ: 3) a+b is to a as a is to b AND 1) a+b/a = ϕ AND a/b = ϕ
Self-concept is to self-perception as self-perception is to self-definition.

**EXAMPLE**
* a = I am a man. (self-perception) //contextless so any response possible, must be true
* b = I am florist. (self-definition) //limited to context, must be true
* a+b = I am a man that is a florist. //combination for self-concept, must be true as it relates to a and b
* a+b/a = ϕ AND a/b = ϕ //"ϕ" is understood as sense of self, or the feeling of identity, uniqueness, and self-direction. both variable answers for a, b acknowledge that at minimum I am (~I am) and provide some datapoints to understand the self.
* ~I am = Self-concept //an idea of the self

Self-concept (*a+b*) is to self-perception (*a*) as...
* Your self-concept is how you perceive (or understand) yourself. Self-concept is formed by self-perception.

...as self-perception (*a*) is to self-definition (*b*).
* Your self-perception is how you define (or communicate) yourself. Self-perception is formed by self-definition.

# IDENTITY AS A JULIA SET
Identity is the encapsulation of the sense of self, which is the feeling of identity, uniqueness, and self-direction.
* the suffix ...[] is used to denote a sequential array. an array is a contiguous collection that can be accessed by the means of their index value
* so using an example array of [apple, pear, orange] named 'example', the value of example[0] is 'apple', the value of example[1] is 'pear', the value of example[2] is 'orange'
* identity[] is a sequential array of results from the equation of the Filled Julia Set for **fc, c = 1 − ϕ** where ϕ represents the formula a+b/a //TODO how to denote formula vs value of ϕ?
* identity[0] is the BEGIN iteration.
* identity[n-1] is the END iteration where n is the total number of iterations
* identity[x] is any iteration of the Filled Julia Set for **fc, c = 1 − ϕ**
* ϕ in the above equation is understood to be the sense of self //sense of self is the engine for identity because it can be used to define itself (recursion, property #4 of the golden ratio, or **ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ**)

![](image.png)

**BEGIN** //first iteration of identity or identity[0]
* For **fc, c = 1 − ϕ**
* Binary state of identitification of 'I am alive'
* a = I am alive //exist, greatest possible context for self, encapsulates the entirety of the identity
* b != I am alive //cannot be equal to I am alive because b must be of a lesser scope than a (*a > b > 0*)
* a+b/a AND a/b = undefined //When b is null (no data, empty), must ask "Who am I?" again.
* The result from identity[0] is *c = 1 - undefined* //although undefined, I know I am alive and that I am the one who asked "Who am I?"

I am alive, who am I?

**END** //last iteration of identity or identity[n-1]
* For **fc, c = 1 − ϕ**
* Binary state of identitification of 'I am not alive'
* The values for a, b are notional and assume that either question could be asked to an identity. The values for a, b are what can be inferred.
* a = I am not alive //no "I" exists so not alive, the question "Who am I?" would not be asked 
* b = I am not alive //no "I" exists so not alive, no "I" (*you*) exists to ask "Who are you?" about
* a+b/a = ϕ AND a/b = ϕ //proptery of ϕ, ideally the formula a/b equals ϕ
* a/b = I am not alive/I am not alive = 1 //not equal to ϕ, but the proportion of a to b is 1
* When ratio equals 1, c equals 0 (fc, c = 1 - 1) and identity ends at identity[n-1]. //This is only time you can truly and fully know "I" because "I" has ended (ie no additional iterations to generate datapoints)

I know who I am.

# PROPORTIONAL REALTIONSHIP OF TRUE VARIABLE ANSWERS

**Always True**
* the equation for the Golden Ratio is analogous to the equation for the constant of proportionality in that **ϕ = a/b** and **k = y/x**
* //Golden ratio as a formula, 1.618 is the ideal result for fc, c = 1 -  ϕ (when ϕ is used as an equation). equation will give other values when a, b not in proportion/true (see END) //TODO 'ideal value' is ϕ (1.618), understood as the product of the equation a+b/a or a/b
* When at the Golden Ratio, ϕ = a+b/a AND **ϕ = a/b.** //see property #1 of golden ratio
* So values of a, b from the Golden Ratio equation can be substituted for the values of y, x in the equation for the constant of proportionality //arithmetic
* y = kx //equation for constant of proportionality
* k = y/x //any proportional relationship
* END iteration gives a value for a/b = 1 (I am not alive/I am not alive = 1, also y/x = 1)
* due to the fact that death and/or end of identity is inevitable, the value 'I am not alive' *will* be true for anyone at some point in their life because an end is inevitable. 
* the proportion of 'I am not alive'/'I am not alive' is 1 and always true for both a, b. as a ratio of two directly proportional variable answers, the value of 1 *when taken as the result of the golden ratio equation in the END iteration* represents a universal and always true value.
* 1 = truth, or the proportion of two universal, directly proportional, and true variable answers 

I will end.

**Truth**
* y = kx //equation for constant of proportionality
* x = y/k
* y = a //Who am I?, variable answer that acknowledges "I"
* x = b //Who are you?, variable answer that acknowledges "I"
* y = kx OR y = k * (y/k) OR y = ky/2k --> **y = y/k** //substituted predefined values for y, simplified, see above
* x = y/k OR x = kx/k OR **x = x** //substituted predefined values for x, simplified, see above

So when k = 1, 
* y = 1x --> y = x
* x = y/1 --> x = y

Truth is truth. //a truth and a truth are proportionless in relation to their manifestation of truth.

# VALUE OF VARIABLES ANSWERS a, b IN THE GOLDEN RATIO EQUATION 
For each instance of ϕ in fc, c = 1 - ϕ where ϕ is understood as sense of self
* **ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ** //a property of ϕ is that it can be used to define itself. this property is referred to here as arbitership.
* ϕ = (a+b)/a //because each *a* provides contextual truth to each *b* for any single calculation of ϕ, a is equal to 1 (see value for truth, k = 1 in END iteration)
* ϕ = (1 + b)/1 //substitute for *a*
* ϕ = 1 + b //simplify
* ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ //*b* must equal 1/ϕ, the self is an arbiter to itself, or is able to define itself because it is the utlimate authority on itself (see above property of ϕ)
* **a = 1** //value for answer to "Who am I?", self-perception
* **b = 1/ϕ** //~0.6180, value for answer to "Who are you?", self-definition

I have a choice. //self can define itself, or "I" discover my identity through my choice in variable answers.

# THE "I EXIST" EQUATION 

**EXAMPLE**
* Let identity[x] represent an iteration of **fc, c = 1 − ϕ** 
* identity[0] is the BEGIN iteration.
* identity[n-1] is the END iteration where n is the total number of iterations
* The result from identity[0] is *c = 1 - undefined*, see BEGIN //although undefined, I know I am alive and that I am the one who asked "Who am I?"

So, for identity[1] 
* GIVEN: from identity[0] (BEGIN) it is known (as *datapoints*) that (1) I am alive and (2) I am the one who asked (who am I?) and identity[n-1] (END) shows that (3) *k* = 1 //k = 1 because truth is assumed.
* y = a //(1) I am alive.
* x = b //(2) I am the one who asked. only context for identity[1] is I am alive and that I have already asked, "Who am I?"
* y = kx //equation for constant of proportionality
* x = y/k //equation for constant of proportionality
* k = 1 //(3) shown in identity[n-1] (truth)
* y = kx (see next line)
* **I am (alive) = I am (the one who asked) * 1** //~I am = ~I am, both acknowledge that at minimum I am
* x = y/k (see next line)
* **I am (the one who asked) = I am (alive)/1** //~I am = ~I am, both acknowledge that at minimum I am
* The above shows that in identity[1] is the first time ϕ can be calculated based on available datapoints. it is the first time that "I" is percieved AND defined within ϕ.

I am. //1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ

# 1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ
The above "I exist" equation can be understood in terms of the following:
* EXTERNAL: "I am" has the meaning that "I am a living being in reality" //"in reality" because reality is implied in the context of either *a* or *b* in the equation for ϕ and, therefore, the context of "I am" must be reality also. More specifically, "Who are you?" and "Who am I?" (contained in the equation for ϕ) are observable events.
* INTERNAL: When the value of self-definition (1/ϕ) is subtracted from the value of the self (ϕ), the value that remains is 1. //oneness, or 1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ
* INTERNAL: Oneness is a way to understand oneself. when the self is understood as the product of an equation, the value of self-definition is distinct from the value of self-perception because it requires an external cause (to be asked "Who are you?" is an external cause). So subtracting the value of self-definition from the value of the self is an exercise in 1) freeing one's self from external influence and 2) being whole (oneness,1).
* So, oneness is simply the self without external cause. self-government follows.
* note: the irrational number ϕ can be used to calculate a real number, 1
