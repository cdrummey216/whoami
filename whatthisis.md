The echo is the present when the present is understood to be the culmination of universal caustion and time. Life, in this context, is the product of amendable conditions (causes) born out of randomness. Life is good.

big bang --> gravity --> time --> stars --> planets --> water --> life

## HUMANITY IN NATURE
The human body, as a category, is the result the echo's progression through time (ie evolution). The mind and its processes of thought and feeling are tethered to reality by the body. The human form in nature is a reflection of the echo as the culmination of evolutionary processes. Therefore, the physical mechanisms that are at the root of these processes are the lens through which humanity experiences reality. The 'lens' captures a reflection of reality and stores it as memory in the brain.

**Human nature is a duality and balance is the ideal.**
