# whatisthis

The echo is the present when the present is understood to be the culmination of universal caustion and time. Life, in this context, is the product of amendable conditions (causes) born out of randomness. Life is good.

big bang --> gravity --> time --> stars --> planets --> water --> life


# HUMAN NATURE
The human body, as a category, is the result the echo's progression through time (ie evolution). The mind 
and its processes of thought and feeling are tethered to reality by the body. Therefore, the physical 
mechanisms that are at the root of these processes are the lens through which humanity experiences reality.
Human nature, therefore, is a reflection of the echo. 

**Human nature is a duality and balance is the ideal.**
