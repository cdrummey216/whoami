111,7


I don't know about _you_, but when _I_ see the number seven (7) -- on a sign, in my email inbox, on a receipt-- I think to myself: Thats a good number. And when I catch doubles or triple sevens during the course of my day, I know that those 7's mean something. What do they mean to me? What is the meaning?

An answer is in the binary representation of seven (111). Triples. Binary is fascinating. It is a numeral system that is so simple it sounds complicated. Its just 1's and 0's. But, you know, a whole lot of them. They come together in various shapes and patterns to create unique and distinct things when converted from binary to another system.

I wrote another book about 'this'. It was an attempt to know more, and I needed a way to organize the whiteboard in my office. I had come to the culmination of the identity equations and I carried with me a simple truth. _You only live once._ The sound is like a ringing bell, or water flowing over stones, or the silence in monotony. 

_You(1) only(1) live(1) once(1)._ 

You are real. _You(1)_ are present in your body wherever you are. You can't be somewhere else, so you are only(1) your body. You are living(1) and so far as you know, its just this once(1). 1111. Quadruples. To me, this was a decimal representation of my truth. So, I converted it to binary (10001010111) and used that as a representation for the entire truth on my white board, in my notepad, etc. It was, in essence, a binary representation of my description of the base layer of reality.

It get's interesting because when we catch a glimpse of a 7 while at the grocery or in a book, and we think --what does this mean?-- its acutally just the tail end (111) of the base-layer 10001010_111_. And the base-layer is foundational, and its truth, and its not easy, sometimes. But, it is good.




A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit, or binary digit. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices, as a preferred system of use, over various other human techniques of communication, because of the simplicity of the language.
