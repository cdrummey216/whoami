# Overview & Purpose
The following are the conclusions and judgements that can be made based on the [identity equations](whoiam.md) while in the absence of other knowledge. The inferences inherent in the BEGIN and END iterations provide a foundation for understanding the self and its place in the world. The BEGIN and END iteraions are limits ('floor', 'ceiling') on each life, such that there is a finite amount of time between either iteration. The time between the iterations is the duration of existence (life), which is perceived by the self through memory (stored memories in a sequence).

# universal truth, or a common good

**Why is a common good necessary?**

* Once an answer to 'Who am I?' is established, the question 'What am I?' naturally follows because an explanation is needed for *how* or *in what manner* an identity exists in reality (I am but how?).  The answer to the question 'What am I?' serves as the foundation for understanding the self because the answer meaningfully connects an identity to reality. 
* What am I? //'I am a living being.' 
* In order to be considered 'living', an identity (self) must be 'alive'. //I know I am alive because the BEGIN iteration demonstrates that self is alive utilizing the binary state of alive/not alive
* Living (to be alive) is a binary state, so only one alternative exists. Any reasonable person would agree that being alive is better than being not alive. (good > not good (bad), alive > not alive)
* Life is good. //existential calm, or I know who and what I am. I conceive my self and understand how my self exists in reality and therefore can begin to make sense of the world around me. 'good' is a judgment made about what the binary state ('alive'/'not alive') *represents*, or 'Life'. The judgement that *Life is good* is universal because the only alternative ('I am not alive') represents death, which any reasonable person would percieve as 'not good'. Death is 'not good' from the perspective of the self because it reresents the end of self. Death is also good as a part of Life. See also END iteration, c = 0
* A shared consciousness is created whenever there is shared knowledge (truth or belief) between two or more individuals. for example, two people have a shared consciousness when they have shared the same experience (ie truth, actual event) or when they believe the same thing (ie belief, government/religion/choice). So, a common good (*universally true AND good*) has the potential to be the foundation of a universally true shared consciouness (ie every individual agrees that 'Life is good').

# The Lonely Isle

**Key Topics**

* Imagine yourself, alone on a desert island, seeking the unknown. 
* Ultimately, what is knowable is what is observable on the island. //no other person on island, alone with self and knowledge of identity equations. the BEGIN iteration shows that 'I am alive'. knowable = observable
* Its observable that you are alive, a living being. //because living is a binary state, only one alternative exists. any reasonable person would agree that being alive is better than being dead. (good > not good (bad), alive > not alive)
* with the judgement that 'Life is good', existential angst converts to existential calm. //I am because I live. The END iteration shows that an end for self is inevitable, so it is good to be alive when it is always true that 'I will end'. 
* I am on the Lonely Isle and I am equipped with the knowledge that I will die someday (future) and the observation that I am alive (now).

**What can also be known?** 

I am on the Lonely Isle and I am equipped with the knowledge that I will die someday (future) and the observation that I am alive (now).

**Conclusions about Life**

* The time between now and the future (end) is what remains of your life. 'time' is a limited resource of life with scarcity for a given context. *Therefore, time has value.*
* I know I exist (I am) because I can observe that I am alive. it is observable that 'this' is not empty, because I exist (now). *Therefore, 'this' is not empty because I exist now.*
* it will be observable that life compounds over time, building upon itself. each life (living being) is an event that has begun but not yet ended, or an incomplete event. the binary state of complete/incomplete describes a chronological state, whereby an *incomplete* state must precede the *complete* state. the *incomplete* state positions a living being at a point in time before its end (*complete*), which the living being is progressing towards (in time) because it is always true that each life will end. *Therefore, Life is tributary to itself.*

**Conclusions about Time** //hypothetical

**Key Points**
* Life (existence) has a beginning and an end, a duration of time lies between those two points in time.
* Time is a product of perception. The self percieves time through memory. Memory is sequential.
* A constant value for Time can be calculated using the value for self because time is something that is perceived.
* The *perception of time* is the result of the golden ratio equation when the value for *a* is ϕ (self) and the value for *b* is 1 (existence). The product of these values is a representation of time amd  is ϕ or 1.618....
* Every event in reality has the temporal dimensions of a beginning and an end, a start and a finish, an open and a close. //BEGN and END iterations

**Calculation of Time Constant** //hypothetical
* As a fractal set, identity at any time is the product of c = 1 - ϕ. The value of ϕ represents the self. The value '1' in the equation represents a life, which is meant as the self's existence (here & now). So, the value of self is ϕ and the value of the relative life is 1.
* An equivalency shown in the identity equations is 1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ (see the 'I exist' equation, represents existence)
* An equivalency shown in the identity equations is ϕ = 1 - 1/ϕ (see the value of variable answers, represents self)
* growth (*a + b*) is to self (*a*) as self (*a*) is to existence (*b*) //because of property a > b > 0, 'existence' represents life (at minimum, lack of self) and *a* and (*a + b*) represent increments of growth (over time)
* 'Life' is an event with a beginning and an end. The self perceieves 'time' through its perception of 'life'. //BEGIN and END iterations
* The BEGIN and END iteraions are limits ('floor', 'ceiling') on each life, such that there is a finite amount of time between either iteration. The time between the iterations is the duration of existence, which is perceived by the self through memory (stored memories in a sequence).
* **ϕ *as time* = ϕ *as self* + 1 (*existence*) / ϕ *as self*** //important, ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/ϕ
* The *perception of time* is the result of the golden ratio equation when the value for *a* is ϕ (self) and the value for *b* is 1 (existence). The product of these values is a representation of time amd  is ϕ or 1.618....

# Time Constant //hypothetical
* ϕ or 1.618....
* ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/ϕ
* The Golden Ratio, or Phi, is a constant produced by time //hypothesis

**Quantum Mechanics** //support for ϕ *as time*
* The g-factor of the electron is defined as the ratio of its magnetic moment to its spin angular momentum.  The electron g-factor is due to the stretching of space-time as the electron spins at the speed of light.
* Electron g-factor = -2/sin(ϕ)
* Proton g-factor = 2ϕ/sin(1/ϕ)
* The Golden Ratio, or Phi, is a constant produced by time //hypothesis
