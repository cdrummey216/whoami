# The Complexity of Now

## Now

The complexity of now relies on someone being present to experience it. 'Someone' will always have an identity and a sense of self. Identity is the observable expression of the sense of self each person has.

# Part 1: What is 'someone'?

## A Formula for Identity
An identity is one of a kind. An identity belongs to itself. An identity is a testimony of the sense of self. *Who we are* are the things that we value in our lives and, most often, these things are the qualities, beliefs, and ideals that we model our selves after in our day to day interactions. As each life extends from the first days across the intervening years to the final moments, we are expressing our selves through our identities in the words we choose and the actions we decide to take. In this way, identity is the highest means of self-expression and self-expression is a reflection of our inner most self. 

How can you understand your self without understanding what your identity is? _Identity is your composition, the combination of your distinct experiences and unique perspcetive on life._

Everyone possesses an identity. Everyone has a distinct identity. In software development, an identity is a unique identifier assign to a single record in a database. This identity cannot be duplicated or copied and solely exists to identify a single record. 

## The Golden Ratio

### What is it?

The "golden ratio" refers to a mathematical relationship between two numbers that is observable when the ratio of the sum of the numbers (a+b) divided by the larger number (a) is equal to the ratio of the larger number divided by the smaller number (a/b).The golden ratio is approximately 1.618, and represented by the Greek letter phi, ϕ.

The golden ratio can be approximated using the Fibonacci numbers, which are numbers in a sequential, never-ending pattern that begins with 0 and 1, and continues infinitely by adding the previous two numbers. For example, the sequence [0,1,1,2,3,5] represents the first six numbers in the sequence and the pattern is seen in the fact that the sum of the first two numbers (0,1) equal the third number (1). The pattern continues in that the sum of the second and third numbers (1, 1) equal the fourth number (2) and so on.

As the the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence increase, the ratio of any two sequential numbers approach the golden ratio. To put it differently, the higher the Fibonacci numbers are in the sequence, the closer their ratio is to 1.618. As shown below, the quotient of 89 and 144 is much closer to the golden ratio that the quotient of 2 and 1, which are much lower in the Fibonacci sequence. 

                    2/1 = 2
                    3/2 = 1.5
                    5/3 = 1.666666...
                    ...
                    144/89 = 1.61797752809
                    ...
                    4181/2584 = 1.61803405573

Also called the "divine proportion," the golden ratio is frequently displayed in the natural world. A common example is the golden spiral, which is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is ϕ and is a self-similar spiral curve the is observable in things like seashells, hurricanes, and spiral galaxies. Furthermore, the number of petals on a flower or the sides of an unpeeled banana will often be Fibonacci numbers and the pine cones twist in opposing spirals of Fibonacci numbers.

### Examples in Nature

The natural world is chaotic and unpredictable but, as a physical realm, it is organized and bound by the laws of mathematics. A fundamental way in which mathematics manifests itself in physical phenomenon is through the golden ratio. Natural processes like the spiraling of a galaxy or the revolution of a hurricane exhibit the same logarithmic spirals found in the golden spiral. Numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and the golden spiral are also observabled in various life forms that have evolved on Earth such as the number of petals on flowers or in the length and number of the arms on a starfish.

These things on display are complex, old, and natural. The golden ratio is a fundamental part of our physical realm and is a guiding influence on animate/inanimate objects in the world.

The golden ratio is exhibited in the forms of:

* Flowers & trees
* Hurricanes & Galaxies
* Human body

### Examples in Humans

The discovery of the golden ratio and examples in human endeavors. 

What is more complex than humans? Humans are a product of evolution in nature and are, therefore, natural beings with a chronology that is intertwined with the natural world. The human form exhibits the golden ratio in the face and in the  extremities. 

What is more complex than the human mind? 

The human mind can comprehend, understand and communicate the furthest intricacies of the universe. Could it be that the complexity of the human mind can be decoded using the golden ratio? It stands to reason that the human mind would also follow the golden ratio.

An economy is the output of the choices made by its constituents on buying and selling. Econmy is ultimately a human endeavor.

The golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence are popularly used to analyze the economic performance. Technical analyst in the financial industry will use four applications of the Fibonacci sequence to analyze the historical performance of one investment or another to predict buying and selling trends. The four applications are retracements, arcs, fans, and time zones and are commonly displayed as data charts. Each approach uses the Fibonacci sequence to analyze the performance of a certain investment and make predictions about the investment's future. 

Technical analysts also use the golden ratio, most often as three percentages of key Fibonacci numbers: 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%.

Even the human body is subject to the gold ratio, the proportions of the length of the nose, the position of the eyes and the length of the chin, are believed to conform to some aspect of the Golden Ratio. According to evolutionary research, physical attraction depends on ratio and, in particular, symmetry in facial structure. Our attraction to another person's body increases if that body is symmetrical and in proportion. Likewise, if a face is in proportion, we are more likely to notice it and find it beautiful.

Scientists believe that we perceive proportional bodies to be more healthy.

## The Property of Truth

### What is it?

Truth is difficult to define. There is inner truth, higher truth, shared truths. The most reliable and undeniable of truths are those that are observable. These truths are the things that happen in real-time. Truth is a property that is binary (true/not true) and has a universal scope. Something that is true cannot be more or less true than another thing that is true. To put it differently, comparing two truths in their 'truthiness' is meaningless because the ratio between truths is 1:1.

### Why !;!?

When something has truth, it means that it is demonstrative of reality. As a result, what ever the object, it will also possesses the resilience that comes with truth. a truth will remain truthful through time and will only change its 'truthiness' after the introduction of new knowledge.

### What is its source?

The assignment of 'truth' to an object relies on the fact that an observer exists to declare the truth. So truth, the great equalizer across time, is a human creation that flows out from our minds. We observe the property of truth in certain objects because they display a reflection of reality in either form or function. Things that have truth will remain truthful until such time that a new observation or discovery changes the understanding of truth.

The observer of the property of truth, then, possesses the perception of the truth through their understanding of the truth that has been observed. As the observer, then, the self percieves the truth in the ways in which the self understands the truth. 

### Identity from the Sense of Self

In order to be understood, identity and its components must be defined. The sense of self exists within an individual and is externalized as the identity. When a value is assigned to the sense of self, a fractal set can be can be calculated. The output, the fractal set, is a representation of the identity in real-time. The identity is something that is externalized by the sense of self at any given moment. The value of the sense of self is the proportion of any two statements, or variable answers, about the identity to which it is describing. For example, the identifications of "I am a friend" and "I am a musician" are true variable answers that describe an identity. Therefore, the proportion of true variable answers about an identity is ultimately the product of the choices _made by the self_ in how it identifies itself. The choice _in what manner_ to identify oneself belongs wholly to the self. Identity is the product of a free will.

The golden ratio proposition as the value for sense of self. The sense of self is an output of a human mind that is singularly focused on the identification of the specific human mind it describes. So, when the sense of self is conceptualized as the ratio of the values we assign to how we understand and communicate our selves, the golden ratio is the ideal result because it is an observable ideal in other life forms (flower petals, shells) as well as the inanimate things (hurricanes, galaxy spirals).

## Concepts

The famous foundation of knowledge from Descartes, _cogito ergo sum_ or "I think, therefore I am", reveals that "I am" because "I" think, which is an _internal process_ carried out _by the self_. What this means is that the cogito, as it is often referred, proves that the self ("I") is cognizant due to the fact that the self is able _to think_ and therefore, the self must exist. However, it has no affirmations on the existence of another "I" apart from the one that is actively thinking, or whether reality exists prior to "I" thinks. So, what is _my_ self? How is it externalized in reality from _my_ self? Can I identify my self and the self of another in reality? How?

**Who am I?: A Question**

"Who am I?" is a question with a variable answer, or, a question that can be satisifed by an inumerable count of distinct answers.
The response "I am the one who asked" is an example of an answer that is universally true. In other words, any individual 
at any time would be able to provide this answer and also satisfy the question.

Other answers to this question could be responses like "I am a man" or "I am a florist", but these both have the potential for change. 
A man was once a child and a florist could sell their business. So, in this way, answers to the question "who am i?" are subject to change
over time.

The famous foundation of knowledge from Descartes, _cogito ergo sum_ or "I think, therefore I am", reveals that "I am" because "I" think, which is an _internal process_ carried out _by the self_. What this means is that the cogito, as it is often referred, proves that the self ("I") is cognizant due to the fact that the self is able _to think_ and therefore, the self must exist. However, it has no affirmations on the existence of another "I" apart from the one that is actively thinking, or whether reality exists prior to "I" thinking. So, what is _my_ self? How is it externalized in reality from _my_ self? Can I identify my self and the self of another in reality? How?

Identifying as ***the one who asked*** positions the "asker" as an active participant in the curation of their identity. From this perspective,
the individual has the ability to accept or reject a given answer at any time. If a routine of asking and answering "Who am I?" is 
established, then each answer can be assessed individually or as a trend over time and used to distinguish desirable and undesirable attributes and qualities.
When combined with a free will, this ability allows the "asker" to discover who they are, in thoughts and actions.

**Who are you?: A Question**

"Who are you?" is a question that is satisfied by any answer from the responder that acknowledges the existence of "I" (*you*). In effect, this means that the responder will choose to define themselves because the choice in response is dependent upon the responder. 

"Who are you?" is also a question that acknowledges the existence of another "I". A universal response to this question is "I am not the one who asked", the inverse of the variable answer "I am the one who asked." An additional universal response to this question is "I am," when "I" is understood to be the entirety of the identity.

**The Self, an engine for Identity: A Statement**

This question, as a routine, is the engine for identity. ***The one who asks*** is seeking an answer and therefore possesses the power to accept or reject an answer. The routine becomes a reference point on which one can build their active identification, or, accummulate the things that they identify with.

**FREE WILL AND IDENTITY: A Relationship**

The product of a free will is an identity. An identity is the culmination of an individual's choices for active identification,
or, the things that they choose to identify with.

**TRUST AND BELIEF: A Statement**

In order to believe, one must trust. Trust is an active quality exchanged between identities because it can be given and recieved and it has social value. Trust is a foundational element of an identity. Trust is valuable because it is given and recieved by out of someone's own free will, a willful act. When trust is established, it facilitates social interaction between individuals. For example, an individual can, in a single exchange, grant their trust to and recieve 
the trust of another individual. Trust facilitates the exchange of ideas.

A belief is partial or full assurance without positive knowledge or absolute certainty. In order to believe in any one thing, an individual must grant their trust to that which they believe. So, in this way, belief becomes a product of free will through the act of choosing to grant trust. Trust is a foundational element of an
identity and is the currency of exchange between identities. 

**AN _EXTERNAL_ FOUNDATION FOR KNOWLEDGE: A Statement**

I asked "Who am I?", therefore I exist. //in real-time

By asking "Who am I?", one has simultaneously taken an action that defines "I" and infers the existence of "I". "I" is
defined as "I am the one who asked" and "I" must exist because it can be defined in real-time.

Asking "Who am I?" is a action that can be observed. Due to this fact, I can signal to another "I" (another _external identity of another_) that I exist, and vice versa. The asker, at the moment of asking, will know that they are the asker because they identify as the asker with the knowledge that "I am the one who asked." Another individual could also hear the asker and determine that "I" (relative to the asker) exists because it can be defined.

**Variable Answer: An Answer**

A variable answer is used to represent a response to a question that is infinite in scope so long as it acknowledges the inferences in the question. For example, "Who are you?" is a question that is satisfied by any answer from the responder that acknowledges the existence of "I" (*you*). In effect, this means that the responder will choose to define themselves because the choice in response is dependent upon the responder. 

"Who are you?" is also a question that acknowledges the existence of another "I". A universal response to this question is "I am not the one who asked", the inverse of the variable answer "I am the one who asked." An additional universal response to this question is "I am," when "I" is understood to be the entirety of the identity.

Variable answers occur in inverse pairs. For example, "I am a man" shares equal value, in context, to "I am not a man." The value of a variable answer is determined by the identity it describes. For example, the value of the variable answer of "I am a student" differs between the PHD candidate and a child waiting for the recess bell. In this way, *the value of any variable answer is only relevant to the other variable answers describing the same identity.* In effect, this means that the "I" is the arbiter of their identity because values are assigned to variable answers by that arbiter.

A variable answer that defines an identity is self-similar due to the fact that the identity it defines ("I") remains the same while being defined ("I am *x*."). At any scale, a variable answer is a representation of the identity.

**Identity as a fractal set: A Representation**

Each identity can be regarded as a fractal set, or a never ending pattern of variable answers in response to the question "Who are you?" or "Who am I?" This pattern is a _stream of answers_ over time concentrated on a singlular topic, or the self.

## Propositions, _meaning_ from Fractal Set calculations, & "I" AS IT EXISTS IN REAL-TIME

### GOLDEN RATIO AND SENSE OF SELF: A Proposition
A calculation of the Golden Ratio (ϕ) using variable answers, or values for a,b from "Who am I?" and "Who are you?". 

The value of ϕ (1.618) is the result of an equation using two given values (a, b) that have specific properties in relation to each other. When these properties are present, the values are in the golden ratio. As it relates to the calculation of identity as a fractal set, the value of ϕ (1.618) is the ideal ratio for any two values for a, b. The necessary inputs to calculate identity as a fractal set are two true variable answers for *a* and *b*. Analogous to the golden ratio is the constant for proportionality, which is the ratio between two directly proportional values.

* a+b/a = ϕ AND a/b = ϕ //(1) property of ϕ
* a > b > 0 //(2) property of ϕ, the scope of *a* is greater than the scope of *b* (*a > b > 0*)
* a+b is to a as a is to b. //(3) property of ϕ
* **ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ** //(4) property of ϕ,  ϕ can be used to define itself (method #1).
* **ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/ϕ** //(5) property of ϕ,  ϕ can be used to define itself (method #2).
* a = A variable answer to "Who am I?", gives contextual truth for b, provides the limiting scope for b
* b = A variable answer to "Who are you?"
* a+b = A combination of a and b
* a, b must be true in order to be proportional to each other //proportional as it relates to "I", the scope of a must be greater than b and b must be greater than 0 (zero or nothing)

#### PROPERTIES OF ϕ: 3) a+b is to a as a is to b AND 1) a+b/a = ϕ AND a/b = ϕ
Self-concept is to self-perception as self-perception is to self-definition.

**EXAMPLE**
* a = I am a man. (self-perception) //contextless so any response possible, must be true
* b = I am florist. (self-definition) //limited to context, must be true
* a+b = I am a man that is a florist. //combination for self-concept, must be true as it relates to a and b
* a+b/a = ϕ AND a/b = ϕ //"ϕ" is understood as sense of self, or the feeling of identity, uniqueness, and self-direction. both variable answers for a, b acknowledge that at minimum I am (~I am) and provide some datapoints to understand the self.
* ~I am = Self-concept //an idea of the self

Self-concept (*a+b*) is to self-perception (*a*) as...
* Your self-concept is how you perceive (or understand) yourself. Self-concept is formed by self-perception.

...as self-perception (*a*) is to self-definition (*b*).
* Your self-perception is how you define (or communicate) yourself. Self-perception is formed by self-definition.

#### IDENTITY AS A JULIA SET: The Representation
Identity is the encapsulation of the sense of self, which is the feeling of identity, uniqueness, and self-direction.
* the suffix ...[] is used to denote a sequential array. an array is a contiguous collection that can be accessed by the means of their index value
* so using an example array of [apple, pear, orange] named 'example', the value of example[0] is 'apple', the value of example[1] is 'pear', the value of example[2] is 'orange'
* identity[] is a sequential array of results from the equation of the Filled Julia Set for **fc, c = 1 − ϕ** where ϕ represents the formula a+b/a //TODO how to denote formula vs value of ϕ?
* identity[0] is the BEGIN iteration.
* identity[n-1] is the END iteration where n is the total number of iterations
* identity[x] is any iteration of the Filled Julia Set for **fc, c = 1 − ϕ**
* ϕ in the above equation is understood to be the sense of self //sense of self is the engine for identity because it can be used to define itself (recursion, property #4 of the golden ratio, or **ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ**)

![](image.png)

#### The *Begin* Iteration //first iteration of identity or identity[0]
* For **fc, c = 1 − ϕ**
* Binary state of identitification of 'I am alive'
* a = I am alive //exist, greatest possible context for self, encapsulates the entirety of the identity
* b != I am alive //cannot be equal to I am alive because b must be of a lesser scope than a (*a > b > 0*)
* a+b/a AND a/b = undefined //When b is null (no data, empty), must ask "Who am I?" again.
* The result from identity[0] is *c = 1 - undefined* //although undefined, I know I am alive and that I am the one who asked "Who am I?"

I am alive, who am I?

#### The *End* Iteration //last iteration of identity or identity[n-1]
* For **fc, c = 1 − ϕ**
* Binary state of identitification of 'I am not alive'
* The values for a, b are notional and assume that either question could be asked to an identity. The values for a, b are what can be inferred.
* a = I am not alive //no "I" exists so not alive, the question "Who am I?" would not be asked 
* b = I am not alive //no "I" exists so not alive, no "I" (*you*) exists to ask "Who are you?" about
* a+b/a = ϕ AND a/b = ϕ //proptery of ϕ, ideally the formula a/b equals ϕ
* a/b = I am not alive/I am not alive = 1 //not equal to ϕ, but the proportion of a to b is 1
* When ratio equals 1, c equals 0 (fc, c = 1 - 1) and identity ends at identity[n-1]. //This is only time you can truly and fully know "I" because "I" has ended (ie no additional iterations to generate datapoints)

I know who I am.

### PROPORTIONAL REALTIONSHIP OF TRUE VARIABLE ANSWERS: A Proposition

#### A Universal Truth

* the equation for the Golden Ratio is analogous to the equation for the constant of proportionality in that **ϕ = a/b** and **k = y/x**
* //Golden ratio as a formula, 1.618 is the ideal result for fc, c = 1 -  ϕ (when ϕ is used as an equation). equation will give other values when a, b not in proportion/true (see END) //TODO 'ideal value' is ϕ (1.618), understood as the product of the equation a+b/a or a/b
* When at the Golden Ratio, ϕ = a+b/a AND **ϕ = a/b.** //see property #1 of golden ratio
* So values of a, b from the Golden Ratio equation can be substituted for the values of y, x in the equation for the constant of proportionality //arithmetic
* y = kx //equation for constant of proportionality
* k = y/x //any proportional relationship
* END iteration gives a value for a/b = 1 (I am not alive/I am not alive = 1, also y/x = 1)
* due to the fact that death and/or end of identity is inevitable, the value 'I am not alive' *will* be true for anyone at some point in their life because an end is inevitable. 
* the proportion of 'I am not alive'/'I am not alive' is 1 and always true for both a, b. as a ratio of two directly proportional variable answers, the value of 1 *when taken as the result of the golden ratio equation in the END iteration* represents a universal and always true value.
* 1 = truth, or the proportion of two universal, directly proportional, and true variable answers 

I will end.

#### The Value of Truth
* y = kx //equation for constant of proportionality
* x = y/k
* y = a //Who am I?, variable answer that acknowledges "I"
* x = b //Who are you?, variable answer that acknowledges "I"
* y = kx OR y = k * (y/k) OR y = ky/2k --> **y = y/k** //substituted predefined values for y, simplified, see above
* x = y/k OR x = kx/k OR **x = x** //substituted predefined values for x, simplified, see above

So when k = 1, 
* y = 1x --> y = x
* x = y/1 --> x = y

Truth is truth. //a truth and a truth are proportionless in relation to their manifestation of truth.

#### VALUE OF VARIABLES ANSWERS a, b IN THE GOLDEN RATIO EQUATION 
For each instance of ϕ in fc, c = 1 - ϕ where ϕ is understood as sense of self
* **ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ** //a property of ϕ is that it can be used to define itself. this property is referred to here as arbitership.
* ϕ = (a+b)/a //because each *a* provides contextual truth to each *b* for any single calculation of ϕ, a is equal to 1 (see value for truth, k = 1 in END iteration)
* ϕ = (1 + b)/1 //substitute for *a*
* ϕ = 1 + b //simplify
* ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ //*b* must equal 1/ϕ, the self is an arbiter to itself, or is able to define itself because it is the utlimate authority on itself (see above property of ϕ)
* **a = 1** //value for answer to "Who am I?", self-perception
* **b = 1/ϕ** //~0.6180, value for answer to "Who are you?", self-definition
* When the self is understood as the product of an equation, the value of self-definition is distinct from the value of self-perception because it requires an external cause (to be asked "Who are you?" is an external cause). Subtracting the value of self-definition from the value of the self is an exercise in freeing one's self from external influence.

I have a choice. //self can define itself, or "I" discover my identity through my choice in variable answers.

#### THE "I EXIST" EQUATION: The Answer

**EXAMPLE**
* Let identity[x] represent an iteration of **fc, c = 1 − ϕ** 
* identity[0] is the BEGIN iteration.
* identity[n-1] is the END iteration where n is the total number of iterations
* The result from identity[0] is *c = 1 - undefined*, see BEGIN //although undefined, I know I am alive and that I am the one who asked "Who am I?"

So, for identity[1] 
* GIVEN: from identity[0] (BEGIN) it is known (as *datapoints*) that (1) I am alive and (2) I am the one who asked (who am I?) and identity[n-1] (END) shows that (3) *k* = 1 //k = 1 because truth is assumed.
* y = a //(1) I am alive.
* x = b //(2) I am the one who asked. only context for identity[1] is I am alive and that I have already asked, "Who am I?"
* y = kx //equation for constant of proportionality
* x = y/k //equation for constant of proportionality
* k = 1 //(3) shown in identity[n-1] (truth)
* y = kx (see next line)
* **I am (alive) = I am (the one who asked) * 1** //~I am = ~I am, both acknowledge that at minimum I am
* x = y/k (see next line)
* **I am (the one who asked) = I am (alive)/1** //~I am = ~I am, both acknowledge that at minimum I am
* The above shows that in identity[1] is the first time ϕ can be calculated based on available datapoints. it is the first time that "I" is percieved AND defined within ϕ.

I exist. //1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ, also "I am"

#### 1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ
The above "I exist" equation can be understood in terms of the following:
* Combination of value of self (ϕ) and value of self-expression (-1/ϕ), or **ϕ + (-1/ϕ)** //also ϕ - 1/ϕ
* When the value of self-expression (1/ϕ) is subtracted from the value of the self (ϕ), the value that remains is 1. //oneness, or 1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ
* EXTERNAL: "I am" has the meaning that "I am a living being in reality" //"in reality" because reality is implied in the context of either a or b in the equation for ϕ and, therefore, the context of "I am" must be reality also. More specifically, "Who are you?" and "Who am I?" (contained in the equation for ϕ) are observable events.
* INTERNAL: The combination of the value of self (ϕ) and the value of self-expression (-1/ϕ) represents the ideal vision for the self based upon how it conceives itself and how it actually expresses itself in real-time (present-reality). The ideal vision is how each self wants to be and how the self is manifested. Oneness is when the combination of sense of self (perceptions/definitions of self) and self-expression (externalization) are equal to reality. //1 as reality = ϕ as self - 1/ϕ (externalization)
* Peace is found in the balance of reality and perception (of the self).
* note: the irrational number ϕ can be used to calculate a real number, 1 

### The _external_ Foundation for Knowledge

#### I exist (1), therefore I am (ϕ). //**fc, c = 1 − ϕ**

Basically, if I can prove that I exist (with the identity equations) then I am because I must be.

The identity equations showed, ultimately, that 'I exist' via oneness (1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ). So, when I can prove that _I exist_ using the 'I exist' equation, I know that _I am_ because I _must_ be. When I _also_ know who and what I am, I know existential calm and can externalize it. Oneness into being.

* The 'I exist' equation shows that I exist, so 'I am' because I must. 
* The 'I exist' equation is part of the identity equations, so this means that I can prove 'I am' on the Isle[0].
* Also put, I am because I exist.
* Also put, I exist, therefore I think, therefore I am.

#### Why is it 1 − ϕ?

The self (ϕ) must be externalized in to reality (1) in order for it to _exist_ in reality. The sense of self is the feeling of identity, uniqueness, and self-direction. It is an internal process, happening exclusively within each mind. Each mind, in turn, has the ability to externalize itself in _the words spoken_ and _the things done_.











# Part 2: What constitutes 'someone'? (a: identity isle, concentrated philosophy)

## Overview & Purpose
The following are the conclusions and judgements that can be made based on the [identity equations](idenityequations.md) while in the absence of other knowledge. The inferences inherent in the BEGIN and END iterations provide a foundation for understanding the self and its place in the world. The BEGIN and END iteraions are limits ('floor', 'ceiling') on each life, such that there is a finite amount of time between either iteration. The time between the iterations is the duration of existence (life), which is perceived by the self through memory (stored memories in a sequence). 

## A foundation for reason
* every cause is an effect and every effect is a cause. //in development
* Occam's razor //intersection of mathematics and philosophy

## Universal Truth, or a common good

**Why is a common good necessary?**

* Once an answer to 'Who am I?' is established, the question 'What am I?' naturally follows because an explanation is needed for *how* or *in what manner* an identity exists in reality (I am but how?).  The answer to the question 'What am I?' serves as the foundation for understanding the self because the answer meaningfully connects an identity to reality. 
* What am I? //'I am a living being.' 
* In order to be considered 'living', an identity (self) must be 'alive'. //I know I am alive because the BEGIN iteration demonstrates that self is alive utilizing the binary state of alive/not alive
* Living (to be alive) is a binary state, so only one alternative exists. Any reasonable person would agree that being alive is better than being not alive. (good > not good (bad), alive > not alive)
* Life is good. //existential calm, or I know who and what I am. I conceive my self and understand how my self exists in reality and therefore can begin to make sense of the world around me. 'good' is a judgment made about what the binary state ('alive'/'not alive') *represents*, or 'Life'. The judgement that *Life is good* is universal because the only alternative ('I am not alive') represents death, which any reasonable person would perceive as 'not good'. Death is 'not good' from the perspective of the self because it reresents the end of self. Death is also good as a part of Life. See also END iteration, c = 0
* A shared consciousness is created whenever there is shared knowledge (truth or belief) between two or more individuals. for example, two people have a shared consciousness when they have shared the same experience (ie truth, actual event) or when they believe the same thing (ie belief, government/religion/choice). So, a common good (*universally true AND good*) has the potential to be the foundation of a universally true shared consciouness (ie every individual agrees that 'Life is good').

## The Isle[0]

Why is it called isle[0]? //isle index of zero
* Zero-based array indexing is a way of numbering the items in an array such that the first item of it has an index of 0.
* Zero-based indexing is a very common way to number items in a sequence in software development
* The Isle[0] is a thought experiment based on the identity equations and with particular attention given to the BEGIN (identity[0]) iteration.

**Key Topics**

* Imagine yourself, alone on a desert island, seeking the unknown. 
* Ultimately, what is knowable is what is observable on the island. //no other person on island, alone with self and knowledge of identity equations. the BEGIN iteration shows that 'I am alive'. knowable = observable
* Its observable that you are alive, a living being. //because living is a binary state, only one alternative exists. any reasonable person would agree that being alive is better than being dead. (good > not good (bad), alive > not alive)
* with the judgement that 'Life is good', existential angst converts to existential calm. //I am because I live. The END iteration shows that an end for self is inevitable, so it is good to be alive when it is always true that 'I will end'. 
* I am on the Isle[0] Isle and I am equipped with the knowledge that I will die someday (future) and the observation that I am alive (now).

## Conclusions about Life (on the Isle[0])

Given: I am on the Isle[0] Isle and I am equipped with the knowledge that I will die someday (future) and the observation that I am alive (now).

* The time between now and the future (end) is what remains of your life. 'time' is a limited resource of life with scarcity for a given context. *Therefore, time has value.*
* I know I exist (I am) because I can observe that I am alive. it is observable that 'this' is not empty, because I exist (now). *Therefore, 'this' is not empty because I exist now.*
* It will be observable that life compounds over time, building upon itself. Each life (living being) is an event that has begun but not yet ended, or an incomplete event. The binary state of complete/incomplete describes a chronological state, whereby an *incomplete* state must precede the *complete* state. The *incomplete* state positions a living being at a point in time before its end (*complete* state) which the living being is progressing towards (in time). It is always true that each life will end. *Therefore, Life is tributary to itself.*

## Conclusions about Choice

I must choose if I want to continue to live in real-time. 

* We live in the present, or real-time. Real-time is a continuous stream of stimuli that we must respond to in order to live and continue to live. The choice lies in how we respond at every moment.  
* A single alternative is always available that will end all choice. We can choose to die, which is the choice to preclude all other future choices. 'To preclude all other choices' is to void the requirement that we 'must choose'. So, we always have the ability to 'exit', which can be thought of as a universal choice that allows anyone to escape the 'must choose' requirement.
* To put it differently, if we are ready and we are willing, we can decide to 'not choose' anymore by making the final choice to end choice by ending our life. The END iteration and the Conversation with Death show that the end of life is a choice in some cases and that it is final in all cases.
* The only choice that is unavailable to us if we choose to live is the choice to ‘not choose’. In other words, we must respond to real-time in order to live.
* Foregoing the choice to die in any case is tantamount to choosing to live, because life and death are binary/exclusive. By choosing to not die, we are choosing to live.
* If we must choose how to respond to real-time, we should choose a response that reflects our ideal self.

## Conclusions about Time (on the Isle[0]) //hypothetical

Given: I am on the Isle[0] Isle and I am equipped with the knowledge that I will die someday (future) and the observation that I am alive (now). time has value. therefore, time can be measured. therefore, the unit of time must be real (observable). //gravity as a unit and extra solar travel to measure in absence of gravity

**Key Points**
* Life (existence) has a beginning and an end, a duration that lies between those two points in time is perceived by the self. 
* Time has value. 'Time' is a limited resource of life with scarcity for a given context.
* Time is a product of perception. The self percieves time through memory. Memory is sequential. The perception of time (duration) grows over time (between BEGIN and END).
* A constant value for Time can be calculated using the value for self because 1) time is perceived by the self and 2) the self exists for a duration.
* The *perception of time* is the result of the golden ratio equation when the value for *a* is ϕ (self) and the value for *b* is 1 (existence). The product of these values is a representation of time amd  is ϕ or 1.618....
* Every event in reality has the temporal dimensions of a beginning and an end, a start and a finish, an open and a close. //BEGN and END iterations

**Calculation of Time Constant** //hypothetical
* ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/ϕ means that ϕ (a) and 1 (b) are at the golden ratio  //also ϕ = ϕ/1 AND ϕ > 1 > 0, new method to calculate ϕ?
* As a fractal set, identity at any time is the product of c = 1 - ϕ. The value of ϕ represents the self. The value '1' in the equation represents a life, which is meant as the self's existence (here & now). So, the value of self is ϕ and the value of the relative life is 1.
* An equivalency shown in the identity equations is 1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ (see the 'I exist' equation, represents existence)
* An equivalency shown in the identity equations is ϕ = 1 - 1/ϕ (see the value of variable answers, represents self)
* growth (*a + b*) is to self (*a*) as self (*a*) is to existence (*b*) //because of property a > b > 0, 'existence' represents life (at minimum, lack of self) and *a* and (*a + b*) represent increments of growth (over time)
* 'Life' is an event with a beginning and an end. The self perceives 'time' through its perception of 'life'. //BEGIN and END iterations
* The BEGIN and END iteraions are limits ('floor', 'ceiling') on each life, such that there is a finite amount of time between either iteration. The time between the iterations is the duration of existence, which is perceived by the self through memory (stored memories in a sequence).
* **ϕ *as time* = ϕ *as self* + 1 (*existence*) / ϕ *as self*** //important, ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/ϕ
* The *perception of time* is the result of the golden ratio equation when the value for *a* is ϕ (self) and the value for *b* is 1 (existence). The result (ϕ *as time*) is the output of the self (a) as it perceives existence (b). The self persists through time with the *perception of time*. Therefore, ϕ *as time* (1.618...) can be used as a constant for time.
* The self as a denominator in ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/**ϕ** is the self's perception of itself (in existance).

## A BRIDGE BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND REALITY

**ϕ *as time* = ϕ *as self* + 1 (*existence*) / ϕ *as self***

* "Who are you?" and "Who am I?" (contained in the equation for ϕ *as self*) are observable events. //I exist (external) equation
* The perception of time is ultimately an internal process *for the self*. 
* The *self* is ultimately the interaction of internal processes (*self*) and external processes (*reality*). //how the self reacts to external stimuli in real-time. A real-time process is one that happens in defined time steps of maximum duration and fast enough to affect the environment in which it occurs, such as inputs to a computing system.
* The *perception of time* does not equal *time as it exists in reality*.

**How to quantify perception in reality?**
* Can the physical manifestations of perception (face, brain measurements?) be quantified? //timing of reaction to stimuli
* TEST: brain scans during game of chess? //the resulting measurement of 'perception' as an approximation of real-time or **perception of reality**

## Time Constant //hypothetical
* ϕ or 1.618....
* ϕ = (ϕ + 1)/ϕ
* The Golden Ratio, or Phi, is a constant produced by time //hypothesis

**Quantum Mechanics** //support for ϕ *as time*
* The g-factor of the electron is defined as the ratio of its magnetic moment to its spin angular momentum.  The electron g-factor is due to the stretching of space-time as the electron spins at the speed of light.
* Electron g-factor = -2/sin(ϕ)
* Proton g-factor = 2ϕ/sin(1/ϕ)
* The Golden Ratio, or Phi, is a constant produced by time //hypothesis

**Philosophy**
* specious present
* perceived duration
* time perception and sense of time

## Phase Constant //in development
* y − y0 = A sin (2πt/T ± 2πx/λ + ϕ) in which y0 is the y position at x = 0 and t = 0, A is the amplitude, T is the period and  ϕ is the phase constant.
* phase is 2πt/T ± 2πx/λ + ϕ 
* For this sinusoidal wave, the period T = 1/f for frequency (f), which is how many cycles of a wave passes over a given point per second. 
* The left side y − y0 is the displacement of the wave in the y direction from the initial position, and the value within the parentheses 2πt/T ± 2πx/λ + ϕ is the phase.

## A Conversation with Death

**Key Topics**
* Why? //cannot know life without first understanding death
* when the self encounters death, death asks two questions in sequence. "are you ready?" and "are you willing?" 
* A 'yes' and a 'yes' signals the end of the identity //a master of fate, by fate mastered
* A 'yes' and a 'no' signals the embrace of life //no fear of death and the choice to live
* A 'no' signals fear of death //"are you ready?"

**Are you ready?**

* If yes, proceed. //'ready' is a state of mind, existential calm. life is good and death is a part of each life, death must also be good *in some manner*.
* If no, wait. //to wait is to dread

**Are you willing?**
* For most, the answer is 'no' //there are only a few things someone may be willing to die for
* The fact remains that the answer 'yes' is utlimately a choice a self is *able* to make. //cases where willingness to die exists: suicide, honor (war), love (romeo and juliet), conviction (personal truth, a cause)
* This question highlights the value of ability and intent //the ability to end exists for the self, but the self must have intent in order to end.
* Intent is a choice and ability is a means


## Oneness

**The Vision** //when perception and reality match (are equal). 1 = 1 or 1 = ϕ - 1/ϕ
* EXTERNAL: "I am" has the meaning that "I am a living being in reality" //"in reality" because reality is implied in the context of either *a* or *b* in the equation for ϕ and, therefore, the context of "I am" must be reality also. More specifically, "Who are you?" and "Who am I?" (contained in the equation for ϕ) are observable events.
* INTERNAL: The combination of the value of self (ϕ) and the value of self-expression (-1/ϕ) represents the ideal vision for the self based upon how it conceives and expresses itself in real-time (present-reality). The ideal vision is how each self wants to be and how the self is expressed. *Oneness* is when the combination of sense of self (perceptions/definitions of self) and self-expression (externalization) are equal to reality. //1 *as reality* = ϕ *as self* - 1/ϕ (externalization) 
* Peace is found in the balance of reality and perception (of the self).
* The 'I am' equation shows that oneness can be achieved for the self by harmonizing the self (perceived, abstract) and self-expression (actual, reality)

## a note on humanity

How did the mind evolve?
* Looking up at the stars and down at their reflections (in water). A baby will fixate on a light source, moving their heads and eyes to follow it. As the human form evolved, the 'mind' also developed as a means to interact with the world. Naturally, each being would look up at the skies at night with curiousity or stare into a clear pool at the face appearing before them. Each example is an exercise in curiosity that the mind undertakes to percieve *the world* around them or *itself*.

# Part 3: Life is good. 
Good intentions in both words and actions are an imperitive through good faith and good will.
In order to be intentional, someone must be present to respond in some manner (how do you want to respond). In order to live in real-time, someone must respond. An imperitive arises to be present and to act.

# Part 4: How to be present and to act? (a: Self-expression. Living as art. Here is my self.)

# Part 5: How to be intentional? (a: Framing, universal truth)
