# The Complexity of Now

The echo is the present when the present is understood to be the culmination of universal caustion and time. Life, in this context, is the product of amendable conditions (causes) born out of randomness. Life is good.

big bang --> gravity --> time --> stars --> planets --> water --> life

## HUMANITY IN NATURE
The human body, as a category, is the result the echo's progression through time (ie evolution). The mind and its processes of thought and feeling are tethered to reality by the body. The human form in nature is a reflection of the echo as the culmination of evolutionary processes. Therefore, the physical mechanisms that are at the root of these processes are the lens through which humanity experiences reality. The 'lens' captures a reflection of reality and stores it as memory in the brain.

## Now

The complexity of now relies on someone being present to experience it. 

What is 'someone'? (a: human form in nature, self as phi) 

What constitutes 'someone'? (a: identity isle, concentrated philosophy)

Life is good. Good intentions in both words and actions are an imperitive through good faith and good will.

In order to be intentional, someone must be present to respond in some manner (how do you want to respond). In order to live in real-time, someone must respond. An imperitive arises to be present and to act.

How to be present and to act? (a: Self-expression. Living as art. Here is my self.)

How to be intentional? (a: Framing, universal truth)
